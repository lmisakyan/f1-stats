Родители маленького Ярно были настоящими фанатами, регулярно посещали всевозможные соревнования и даже своего сына назвали в честь финского мотоциклиста Ярно Сааринена, который разбился в Монце в 1973 году, когда сам Трулли был ещё, что называется, только в проекте. Уже в пять лет отец Энцо усадил малыша за руль карта, и вскоре тот начал показывать отличные результаты.
Свой первый чемпионат мира итальянец выиграл в 16 лет, за ним последовало ещё множество побед, переход в немецкую Формулу 3, где Трулли довел до финиша все 27 гонок, в которых участвовал, одержал восемь побед и завоевал титул за явным преимуществом. К началу 1997 года не осталось сомнений в том, что Ярно готов к дебюту в Формуле 1 - уверен в этом был и Флавио Бриаторе, взявший земляка под опеку.
Первый сезон гонщику предстояло провести в Minardi, но уже после семи Гран При (и двух девятых мест) он оказался за рулем куда более быстрой машины. В Канаде угодил в серьезную аварию Оливье Панис - и именно Трулли пригласили заменить его в команде Prost. В первой же гонке он стартовал с шестой позиции, в третьей финишировал четвертым, а по ходу осеннего Гран При Австрии долго лидировал и имел совершенно реальные шансы как минимум подняться на подиум - но подвел мотор.
Стало ясно, что в лице Ярно Формула 1 получила отличного пилота - теперь его ждала задача, которая оказалась не по плечу десяткам других талантов: раскрыть себя в условиях невероятной конкуренции паддока и найти свой путь к вершине. Трулли остался в команде Алена Проста, но 1998 год был испорчен неважной машиной и принес всего одно очко. Следующий оказался чуть лучше и запомнился, прежде всего, вторым местом на Нюрбургринге.

 
Дела Prost шли всё хуже, и итальянец перешел в команду Эдди Джордана. Её машины уже не могли в 2000-м претендовать на победы, как в конце 90-х, но Ярно регулярно зарабатывал очки, закончив сезон сначала на десятом, а потом на девятом месте в общем зачете. Тогда же он зарекомендовал себя настоящим мастером квалификаций, выжимая по ходу единственного быстрого круга из машины абсолютный максимум, используя ни с кем не сравнимый стиль входа в повороты, невероятно плавный и эффективный.
На Гран При Монако 2000 Трулли стартовал вторым и занимал эту позицию на протяжении половины дистанции. Михаэль Шумахер, который лидировал в той гонке, в итоге сошел из-за поломки - увы, но итальянец не смог воспользоваться этим шансом и победить в княжестве, поскольку на его машине отказала коробка передач.
Чемпионат 2002 года Ярно начал в новой команде - Бриаторе, заручившийся поддержкой компании Renault, позвал его вытаскивать из бедственного положения бывший Benetton, Первый сезон, как и следовало ожидать, получился сложным, но во втором явно наметился прогресс: Трулли регулярно стартовал из шестёрки сильнейших, в Монако и Сильверстоуне лидировал по ходу дистанции, а в Хоккенхайме смог, наконец, пополнить свою коллекцию трофеев, финишировав третьим.
Однако результаты молодого напарника, Фернандо Алонсо, оказались куда лучше: испанец выиграл Гран При Венгрии и заработал в общей сложности 55 очков, тогда как у Ярно их набралось всего 33. Пилот сделал из этого поражения верные выводы: в следующем 2004-м он уже ни в чем не уступал испанскому товарищу по команде. Трулли регулярно поднимался на подиум, в Монако стартовал с поула, лидировал почти всю дистанцию и выиграл, и на экваторе чемпионата был на 16 очков впереди Алонсо.

 
Фернандо такая ситуация категорически не устраивала. Поскольку на роль восходящей звезды он подходил куда больше 30-летнего напарника, отношения Бриаторе и Трулли стали портиться. А когда Ярно в безобидной ситуации пропустил атаку Рубенса Баррикелло в последнем повороте Гран При Франции, стало ясно, что в 2005 году он не сможет остаться в Renault. Реальность же оказалась даже более жестокой - пилота уволили прямо по ходу чемпионата…
Так начался очередной период в карьере Ярно - как выяснилось чуть позже, самый продолжительный за все время, что он провел в Ф1. Он стал пилотом Toyota, команды с большими деньгами и большими амбициями. Со старта сезона 2005 года дела пошли не просто хорошо, а прямо-таки отлично. В пяти первых гонках Ярно трижды поднимался на подиум. Серьезные японцы, которым до этого и очки давались с трудом, буквально пускались в пляс от таких результатов. В Индианаполисе он даже выиграл квалификацию - но на старт гонки не вышел из-за шинного скандала.
Продолжение сотрудничества оказалось не столь радужным. Ушел конструктор Майк Гаскойн, команде не хватало опыта и стабильности. Именно тогда в прессе стал все чаще появляться термин ""паровозик Трулли"" - вновь добившись отличного квалификационного результата, по ходу дистанции Ярно был не столь быстр, как соперники, но и пропускать их не собирался - и за его Toyota выстраивался длинный ""хвост"" из машин.
К 2007 году стало казаться, что команда скатилась в самый конец группы середняков - Трулли всего трижды за сезон смог заработать очки. Но сотрудники Toyota уже накопили опыт, реструктуризация позволила избавиться от большого числа не самых нужных руководителей и лишних согласований - дела вновь пошли на лад. В 2008-м Трулли завоевал один подиум, в 2009-м - ещё три, в том числе и второе место на домашнем для команды Гран При Японии.

А потом из-за грянувшего экономического кризиса в компании решили отказаться от дорогостоящей гоночной программы. Места в сильных командах были давно заняты, снова идти к середнякам - значило вновь оказаться в уже несколько раз пройденной ситуации. И Ярно решился принять серьезный вызов: присоединиться к проекту, который только что стартовал с чистого листа.

 
Он назывался Lotus и собрал под одной крышей немало именитых людей из мира гонок. С самого начала было ясно, что работы впереди очень много. Но Трулли, несмотря на проблемы с надежностью и невысокую скорость, продолжал использовать свои знания, накопленные годами выступлений, чтобы двигать команду вперед.
Однако чудес не бывает, тем более в Формуле 1 - обгонять на трассах удавалось лишь таких же ""новичков"" из Virgin и HRT. И к середине второго сезона, когда Ярно замучили постоянные неполадки рулевого усилителя, стало видно, что Формула 1 уже не приносит итальянцу былого удовольствия.
Он уступил машину на один из Гран При 2011-го Каруну Чандхоку, зимой 2012-го отдал один из своих тестовых дней в Хересе Гидо ван дер Гарде, а спустя неделю окончательно покинул команду…
Выступая в Формуле 1 на протяжении 15 сезонов, итальянец завоевал одну победу, четыре поула и 11 раз побывал на подиуме. По количеству стартов в Гран При он занимает четвертое место за всю историю чемпионатов мира. У Ярно Трулли и его супруги Барбары двое детей - шестилетний Энцо и пятилетний Марко. Гонщик является совладельцем винодельческого предприятия и имеет собственную компанию по производству картов. И нет сомнений, что в истории Больших Призов он оставил о себе очень добрую и хорошую память.";

He came to compete in the CM Lotus Euroseries - one of the first rungs on the ladder to Formula 1 - with backing from Arisco (a Brazilian food conglomerate), which intended to take him all the way to the top. In the comfortable environment provided by Scuderia Salvati Draco, Rubens quickly became the seasons front-runner, winning five rounds and the title. 
This triumph earned him a seat in Dick Bennetts West Surrey Racing F3 team for 1991. It was success again as Rubens came through late in the season to win the title when his main rival, David Coulthard, stumbled. 
Already the subject of interest from Formula 1 teams, Barrichello took the next step up into F3000 and, despite the political and financial pressures that beset the II Barone Rampante team, Rubens was a consistent finisher, achieving third place in the final standings. His seemingly inexorable climb to Grand Prix racing was complete when that great talent-spotter Eddie Jordan placed his faith in the 21-year-old to help wipe away the memories of a disastrous 1992 season. 
He soon proved Eddies wisdom with a stunning drive in the rain-soaked European GP at Donington which saw him run as high as second place until fuel-pressure problems ended his race, though this performance no doubt reflected the benefit of having traction control in slippery conditions. However, as the season developed he comfortably outpaced his more vaunted (if demotivated) team-mates Capelli and Boutsen, before the uncertainty regarding Rubens real ability was increased by a succession of partners towards the end of the year. The arrival of Eddie Irvine at Suzuka helped lift the team - and Barrichello - to a new level of performance, and it was felt by many that he needed this sort of competition. 
Certainly he started the 1994 season with real intent, before miraculously escaping serious injury in practice for the San Marino Grand Prix. The horrendous events of that weekend must have left Rubens more traumatised than most as he struggled to come to terms with the loss of his friend and mentor Ayrton Senna. Understandably he took a little while to return to his best, and the joy of taking pole position at a rain-soaked Spa was probably the high point of his, and Jordans, year. 
Rumours abounded that Barrichello was a target for McLaren, but in the event he remained with Jordan for 1995, buoyed by the prospect of a works engine deal with Peugeot. Numerous excellent qualifying performances and second place in Canada showed what could be achieved, but a catalogue of mechanical failures were to cost Rubens and his team dear. The 1996 season soon produced the false dawn of a front-row start in Brazil, but after Barrichello slithered off the wet track in the race his year slipped into a downward spiral in which he never really regained his confidence. 
Despite his tender years, Jordan felt they could coax no more from the personable young Brazilian, who they felt needed to raise his game to a more consistent level if he was to progress beyond the promising category. An amicable parting led to Rubens joining the newly formed Stewart Grand Prix team for 1997. The partnership proved a productive one, and his superb second place in the rain at Monaco gave credibility to both team and driver. While the following year was largely wasted in midfield obscurity, Barrichello emerged in 1999 as a much more mature performer. He ran at the front in a number of races and was rightly disappointed not to have been the man to give Stewart their first Grand Prix win when Johnny Herbert posted an unlikely victory at the Nurburgring. 
Seven seasons in Formula 1 have yet to see the gentle Brazilian take a Grand Prix win, but a dream move to Ferrari in 2000 to partner Schumacher should see that ambition realised at last. Still aged only 27, Rubens can afford to be patient at Maranello and, provided he can cope with the politics and the pressure, he has every chance of inheriting the throne when King Michael decides to step down.";

His breakthrough came in 1989, with his move into junior Formula Ford 1600. He dominated both championships, and joined Paul Stewart Racing in 1990 to contest the British Vauxhall Lotus Challenge and GM Lotus Euroseries. He could possibly have won the former, but a broken leg sustained in an accident at Spa stymied the young Scots chances, and he ended up a disappointed fourth overall. 
Staying with PSR in 1991, Coulthard moved up to Formula 3, and waged a season-long battle with Rubens Barrichello. Despite winning five rounds (one more than the Brazilian), he had to be content with the runner-up spot. There was, however, the satisfaction of winning the prestigious European Marlboro Masters of Formula 3 race at Zandvoort and he followed this up with a stunning drive to win the end-of-season race at Macau - proof indeed that David was truly a star in the making. 
Perhaps expectations were too high as he took the step up to F3000 for 1992 and for a while the Scot struggled to find his feet, but by the end of the year he was on the podium and looking a good bet for honours in 1993 with a switch to the Pacific team. A first win was duly delivered at Enna, but his season tailed off somewhat thereafter. By this time David had had a number of outings as a test driver for the Williams-Renault team and he quickly impressed all at Didcot with his positive feedback. 
He was appointed the teams official test driver for 1994 and was contemplating a third year in F3000 at the season-opener at Silverstone when the dreadful news of Sennas death came from Imola. David overcame his shock to take second place in that race before stepping into the Grand Prix arena and, in the inevitable turmoil that followed, displayed remarkable maturity for one so inexperienced. 
Relaxed and easy off track, he showed tremendous poise behind the wheel. Always aware of the need for him to back Damon Hills title bid, David was the perfect team-mate and, given his performances, must have been disappointed to have to surrender his seat to Nigel Mansell for the last three races of the year. The uncertainty regarding his immediate future was clearly unsettling for Coulthard, who hedged his bets and signed a contract with McLaren for 1995. In the event a tribunal confirmed that he would remain at Williams but his early-season form was decidedly patchy. He was constantly troubled by tonsillitis and it was only after his tonsils were removed that his real ability became apparent. David would have won the British Grand Prix but for a stop-go penalty incurred through no fault of his own, but his dream of a Grand Prix win was finally realised with a truly dominant performance at Estoril. On the debit side, though, he tended to make a number of elementary mistakes which cost him dear, culminating in the embarrassment of sliding into the wall on the pit lane entry in Adelaide. 
David was free to move to McLaren for 1996, but all his innate self-assurance was needed during a difficult first full season with the team. Uncomfortable with the handling of the car, he was often a tad slower than team-mate Mika Hakkinen and, apart from being unlucky not to win in Monaco, generally delivered less than he promised. 
The 1997 season began in the best possible fashion with a win in Australia which signified that McLaren were back after three lean years, and it was generally a much more convincing campaign for the Scot, who was evenly matched with Hakkinen and, having scored another victory at Monza, stepped aside to allow his team-mate to win the seasons finale at Jerez. 
He did the same in the 1998 Australian Grand Prix after a pre-race agreement and in some ways it proved to be his undoing. Hakkinen upped his game as the season progressed to mount his successful championship bid and David was left to play the subordinate role in the team. This pattern was to continue in 1999, with the often unlucky Coulthard too rarely making the absolute most of his equipment. On his day he had the legs of everybody, and no one could catch him at Spa, Magny Cours or Sepang, but only the first of these races brought him the win he deserved. 
For David, the reality appears to be that he is not quite on the same level as Hakkinen or Michael Schumacher, but there should be no shame in that, for he is still a very talented driver with much to offer. His fifth season with McLaren could be crucial to the Scots future. Whether he remains among the elite group contesting the championship, or ultimately slips down the grid to join the also-rans, is very much in his own hands.";

By the time he was ten he was competing in the national Minikart series and he soon progressed through the karting ranks, becoming runner-up in both the World and Intercontinental Championship series, only misfortune denying him the ultimate prize. 
Moving up to Italian F5 in 1992, Fisichella spent two seasons learning his trade before switching to the official RC Motorsport team. Giancarlo then simply scorched away from the opposition, winning ten of the twenty rounds of the series and adding the prestigious one-off Monaco and Macau races to his impressive CV. 
Obviously a talent to watch, Fisichella was snapped up by Minardi on a long-term contract and given the test driver role for 1995 while he gained experience and polished his racecraft in the ITC with an Alfa Romeo 156. Another full season in the high-tech category was successfully completed in 1996, but of greater significance was his Grand Prix baptism with Minardi. Joining the rather more seasoned Pedro Lamy in the Faenza squad, Fisichella immediately showed the speed to eclipse his team-mate, but the young lions blotted their copybooks by colliding on the opening lap at Monaco when points were there for the taking. Fisichella was obliged to make way for Giovanni Lavaggi after the British GP, but his stock was high enough for him to be placed in the Jordan team for 1997 alongside rookie Ralf Schumacher. Certainly it was Giancarlo who looked the brighter prospect with some mature and accomplished performances and the fact that his season tailed off somewhat was no barrier to the young Italians transfer to Benetton after a contract wrangle between Jordan and Flavio Briatore was settled in court. 
Fisichella undoubtedly brought a new sense of purpose to Benetton in 1998 and his two second places in Monaco and Montreal showed that here was a potential Grand Prix winner of the future. His second term presented a similar picture: occasional outstanding performances mixed with lacklustre showings when he failed to cut the mustard. 
Ironically his long-term contract could be a double-edged sword. Already comfortably ensconced in a multi-million-dollar lifestyle, the pleasant, easy-going Roman has yet to produce the goods on a consistent basis. When everything is right he shows the skills to deliver, but such is the pace of Formula 1 that he could rapidly find himself surplus to requirements if he fails to progress.";

Results dipped somewhat the following season but his talent was spotted by Team Joest, who placed him in their Opel Calibra for the 1996 ITC season. This gave the Austrian a chance to gain experience in a high-profile environment, and his career received an unexpected but massive boost when he shared Joests Porsche WSC95 at Le Mans with Manuel Reuter and Davy Jones to become the youngest-ever winner of the Sarthe classic. 
With healthy personal sponsorship, Wurz not only gained a foothold on the Grand Prix ladder with a testing contract with Benetton in 1997 but also had a seat in the works Mercedes squad to race their CLK-GTR alongside Bernd Schneider in the FIA GT championship. When the lanky Austrian stepped into the big time, replacing sinusitis victim Gerhard Berger in Montreal, he was still, however, largely an unknown quantity. Benettons faith in their test driver was not without foundation, though, as he had already proved to be a fast, thoughtful and reliable performer with over 2700 km of track time behind the wheel of an F1 car. 
His three-race stint which culminated in a fine third place in the British Grand Prix, naturally sealed a full-time drive for 1998. Teamed with Italian hot-shot Giancarlo Fisichella, the quiet but tough Wurz showed he was no soft touch as he banged wheels with Michael Schumacher in Monaco and emerged from a roll into the gravel in Montreal seemingly completely unperturbed. A string of solid drives into the points increased Alexs credibility, but his inexorable rise to the top was about to come to an end in 1999 when the Austrian found the inherent characteristics of the B199 at odds with his particular driving style. 
Huge changes in both management and design personnel cannot have helped Benetton in their quest to get back to the top, but Wurz stays on board for another season in 2000 hoping to re-establish his front-line credentials.";

As the younger brother of the prodigiously talented Michael Schumacher, it would have been perfectly understandable if he had opted for a profession as diametrically opposed to his siblings as could be found, but Ralf had other ideas. 
The younger Schumacher first made an impression in German Formula 3 during the 1994 season: driving the ubiquitous Dallara, he only scored a single victory but posted an additional nine top-three finishes to claim third place in the final standings behind runaway winner Jorg Muller and Alexander Wurz. The following year saw Ralf embroiled in a battle with Norberto Fontana for the crown but, despite a run of three wins from four races in mid-season, he was eventually beaten into second place by the diminutive Argentinian. 
Although courted by Opel for a drive in the ITC series in 1996, Ralf and his manager Willy Weber decided that he should race in Formula Nippon in Japan as the next stage of his career development. It was a successful move for the young German, who posted three victories in the Le Mans Co. Reynard 96D to take the title. In addition he shared a Toyota Supra with Naoki Hattori in the All-Japan GT championship. 
His year in Japan was crucial to his personal development - and Ralf certainly needed all his resilience when he stepped up to F1 with Jordan in 1997. He was paired with the equally ambitious and inexperienced Giancarlo Fisichella, and the two young turks slugged it out in a battle for supremacy within the team which was to be counter-productive for everyone. Ralf simply overdrove in his attempts to impress. A podium finish in Argentina should have been cause for major celebration, but it was tainted by his crassness in pushing his team-mate into premature retirement. The prevailing feeling was that Schumacher was wasting the natural speed that even his hardened critics had to admit he possessed in abundance. 
For 1998 the German was joined by Damon Hill and both drivers spent the first part of the season vainly looking for an answer to seemingly insoluble problems, but Ralfs superb drive into sixth place in the wet at Silverstone was to prove the turning point for the team. Schumacher seemed to grow in confidence race by race and was deeply frustrated to have to hold station behind Hill at Spa when Jordans first Grand Prix win was achieved. By then, however, he had already decided to accept an offer from Williams for 1999, much to Eddie Jordans disappointment. 
The conventional wisdom was that it was going to be a year of bedding-in for Ralf, with the planned BMW engine tie-up coming on tap in 2000. Nobody expected fireworks with the team consigned to running Supertec-engined cars, but they were wrong. Schumacher was the revelation of the season and could have won both the Italian and European Grands Prix if circumstances had played into his hands. More than anything, however, he had finally proved that he didnt need big brother at all. He was very much his own man.";

In truth Michaels racing career had been very carefully planned before he ever stepped into a Formula 1 car, and he had the comforting prospect of major manufacturer and commercial backing with which to develop his top-level career. However, he has since proved beyond doubt that he is the supreme driver of the current era, and the target for the others to aim at. 
A former karting star with but a single season of Formula Ford 1600 and Formula Konig in 1988 behind him, Schumacher was signed by leading German F3 team OTS to support Heinz-Harald Frentzen in 1989. It was a closely contested season, with the pair both finishing just one point behind series winner Karl Wendlinger. It was then that Mercedes sporting director Jochen Neerpasch stepped in with his junior-driver scheme which placed all three drivers in the Sauber-Mercedes Group C programme for 1990. Under the wise tutelage of Jochen Mass, the trio were schooled in the art of handling big, powerful cars in a very disciplined and professional framework. In parallel to his sports car drives, Michael was back in German F3, and this time won the series comfortably. He also took in two end-of-season races at Fuji and Macau, and confirmed his talent by winning them both. 
Most drivers would be wanting to try their hand at F3000 by this time, but Michael was happy to stay within the confines of the Mercedes team. This second season saw a change of emphasis with the young lions Schumacher and Wendlinger paired together and allowed their heads. Both did an excellent job, but the consensus was that Michael had the edge, the pairs reward after a trouble-strewn year being victory in the round at Autopolis. With a Formula 1 drive inevitable sooner (as it would turn out) or later, nothing was left to chance and Neerpasch arranged for Schumacher to race a Formula 3000 car at Sugo, well away from the glare of publicity. He finished second and enjoyed the different experience of racing a powerful single-seater. 
A month later came the Jordan drive at Spa which, after his stirring deeds in practice, ended disappointingly when Michaels clutch failed at the start. Suddenly Schumacher was a hot property and after much legal wrangling the somewhat bemused driver was whisked off to join the Benetton team in time for the next race at Monza. Three points-scoring finishes in his first three races were more than enough evidence for Flavio Briatore to plan the teams future around the German star and he was not to disappoint. In his first full Grand Prix season Michael proved to be not only very quick but also remarkably consistent, rarely making costly mistakes and putting in some scintillating performances such as his second place to Mansell in the rain at Barcelona and his climb through the field to third at Monza after being left at the start. Of course, the supreme moment was his fully deserved, if slightly fortunate, win at Spa where he made his own luck - and reaped the rewards. 
The 1993 season provided more evidence of Schumachers increasing maturity. Only Williams dominance stood between him and the top step of the podium on numerous occasions and he took a superbly thought-out win at Estoril. Much work was done over the winter months, and when the new Benetton B194, mated with the Ford Zetec-R V8 engine, was placed in Schumachers hands he left Senna and Williams struggling in his wake in the opening two races. It seemed that the balance of power might be about to shift, and tragically it did so at Imola, leaving Michael with the prospect of chasing a World Championship which he felt would be much devalued by the loss of the Brazilian. From then on his season was to be surrounded by controversy. Amid rumblings that the team were running some form of traction control, Schumacher won six of the first seven Grands Prix, but he was excluded at Silverstone for ignoring the black flag, which was later to earn him a two-race ban, and this, together with the loss of his crushing win at Spa when he was disqualified for having an illegal skid-block, left the door open for Damon Hill to make a late challenge for the title. When the pair collided in Adelaide, Schumacher became Germanys first World Champion, but the manner of his triumph can have brought him little inner satisfaction. 
The following season was to be a different matter entirely as Schumacher, given superb support by the whole Benetton squad, ruthlessly exposed the shortcomings of both the Williams team and their drivers. From the Spanish Grand Prix onwards Michael upped the stakes to put in a succession of brilliant performances. His dominant wins in Monaco, France and Germany looked almost routine, especially when compared with his extraordinary displays at Spa (where he drove through the field from a lowly 16th place on the grid) and in the European GP at the Nurburgring, where, quite frankly, the rest of the field, Alesi apart, were made to look like novices. It was fitting that Michael and Benetton had the opportunity to win the 1995 championship in a manner which reflected their talent and commitment. 
It was natural that Ferrari, so long in the doldrums, should look to Schumacher to return them to the top and they were prepared to stump up a massive retainer to capture his signature. With a huge amount of restructuring needed, his immediate championship prospects for 1996 were not deemed bright, but the German still produced drives of genius, such as in the wet in Spain, and later in the season at Spa and Monza. It was much the same story the following year as Michael took the fight to the superior Williams of Jacques Villeneuve, brilliant wins in the wet at both Monaco and Spa and on slicks on a treacherous track at Magny Cours emphasising his mesmeric car control. His refusal to concede defeat was to lead to an inglorious end to his title challenge in a Jerez gravel trap after an outrageous manoeuvre on his title rival. Schumacher was subsequently stripped of his points and his second place in the championship. 
With the slate wiped clean for 1998, Ferrari were still the underdog, as McLaren Mercedes now boasted the fastest machine on the track. Michael again ruthlessly took advantage of any weakness shown by his rivals and some of his drives (such as in Hungary, and at Spa before he ran into the back of Coulthards ambling McLaren) were on a different plane from the rest. In the end stalling the Ferrari on the grid at Suzuka effectively stymied his title chances for the third time in as many years, but it would be churlish to criticise the German too harshly for his error, as it was only his brilliance that had extended the title fight to the end. 
Schumacher and Ferrari were left facing a fourth attempt to clinch a championship which by now must have seemed like the holy grail. Dominant performances at Imola and in Monaco provided a satisfactory start, but a relatively low-speed shunt on the first lap of the British Grand Prix left the unlucky German with a broken leg. His title chances were gone but Michael still had a major part to play in the championship battle. Having seen Eddie Irvine take over Maranellos challenge and carry the fight to McLaren with tremendous effect, the German was back in action at the penultimate race in Malaysia to aid his number two driver. Not only did he claim pole position but he also dominated the race, allowing Irvine to win and at the same time blunting Hakkinens challenge in a brilliant but controversial display of team tactics. At Suzuka he seemed unable to match the pace of the Finn, who duly took a well-deserved second title. For Michael, the dream of being the first Ferrari driver to win the World Championship since 1979 still remains. Providing he retains his motivation, and Ferrari can continue to give him the equipment, 2000 might be a 21st anniversary for them to celebrate.";

Yet F1s corporate culture and the hawkish nature of some sections of the media have now perhaps turned these superstars into comparatively bland individuals whose thoughts and opinions are screened and shaped before being made public via non-controversial press releases or media conferences. Whether naturally or by intention, the one man who stands out as the exception to the stereotype on all counts is Jacques Villeneuve. His grunge look, complete with bleached hair, appeals to the younger pop-culture generation and his outspoken views on Formula 1 have caused agitation within the portals of the FIA. Indeed young Master Jacques maverick streak got him into hot water back in 1997 when he criticised the new technical regulations in his own inimitable style. 
Being the son of such a legendary father naturally helped Jacques to get his fledgling career off the ground, but after a none-too-impressive three seasons spent in Italian Formula 3 between 1989 and 1991 it seemed that his name was greater than his talent. However, he was soon to prove the doubters wrong when a move to Japan to race in Formula 3 saw him score three victories and take second place in the series. Luck can play a huge part in the shaping of any drivers career and in Villeneuves case it came in the form of an invitation to compete in the 1992 Players Trois Rivieres race in Quebec. Then an unknown quantity, Jacques took a fine third place and his new mentor Craig Pollock set in motion a deal for him to race in Formula Atlantic full-time in 1993. 
The young French-Canadian fought out a three-way battle for the title but, despite seven poles and five wins from fifteen starts, made just a few errors too many and came up short. Crucially, though, Jerry Forsythe and Barry Green decided Jacques was the driver to stick with when they made the move up to the Indy Car championship in 1994. Villeneuve took to the series like a duck to water, and winning a race at Elkhart Lake and finishing a very close second in the Indy 500 contributed to an impressive sixth place in the final standings. The destination of the Rookie of the Year award was a foregone conclusion. Things were to get even better the following year, as Jacques not only became the youngest-ever PPG Cup champion but also scooped the Indy 500 after being two laps down at one stage. His stock was at its highest, and astutely Villeneuve and Pollock decided that the chance of a dream move to Formula 1 with Williams-Renault for 1996 was much too good to pass up. 
Jacques blew into the new F1 season like a full-force gale. He could easily have won his maiden Grand Prix in Australia and as the season progressed he grew an ever-stronger threat to Damon Hill. In fact he came closer to beating his more experienced team-mate than the final points table showed. Crucially, Villeneuves performances convinced the Williams management that they could dispense with the services of their loyal stalwart and put their faith in the bouncy, self-assured enfant terrible. 
Villeneuve duly delivered in 1997 when, with a cocktail of brilliance and some notable gaffes (both on and off track) he squared up to the challenge of Michael Schumacher and Ferrari, and slugged it out right up to the thrilling finale at Jerez, where the German attempted his outrageous blocking manoeuvre. To win the World Championship is hard enough in itself, but to achieve such a feat in only his second year in F1 was a truly remarkable performance. Jacques had to win the title that season, for with Renault pulling out of racing Williams knew they would no longer be the leading force of yore. 
In 1998 Jacques hustled the garishly liveried Williams FW20 for all it was worth, often placing it above quicker cars. After spending the previous two seasons eyeing up the silverware, the French-Canadians expectations were now lowered to a scramble for points-scoring finishes and the odd podium placing. If nothing else, it proved Villeneuves calibre as a top-notch performer, with an added bonus being his realistic acceptance of the position Williams were in. 
Certainly Patrick Head would have liked to hold on to Jacques for a fourth year, but the attraction of the British American Racing project headed up by his mentor Craig Pollock was irresistible. Of course, history now records that the first year for the cocksure new team was one of self-inflicted humiliation as the acquisition of even a single World Championship point proved beyond them. In fairness to Villeneuve, he extracted the very maximum from the car, which on a number of occasions was quite useful. Crucially, he never became disheartened, always gave 100 per cent commitment and absolutely never gave up trying - the qualities of a champion who will surely be back among the winners again.";

The disastrous season that BAR were to endure provided the Brazilian with the toughest of baptisms in the big time. Ricardo was injured in a practice crash at his home track which forced him to miss three races, and then emerged unscathed from a massive off at Eau Rouge during practice for the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa later in the year. Through all this, his self-confidence remained unshakeable, for the ambitious Brazilian has been a champion in every major category in which he has competed. 
His father was a racer on the local dirt tracks around his native Curitiba and the young Ricardo was soon bitten by the racing bug. In 1986 his dad bought him his first kart and the following year his competition career began. By 1991 he was Brazilian champion, and after a season in Formula Chevrolet Zonta moved up to Formula 5 in the Sud-Am series. Six victories in the 1995 season brought him the South American championship and with it the opportunity to go to Europe and race in the F3000 series with the Italian Draco Engineering team. 
Wins at Mugello and Estoril marked him out as a man to watch and, switching to the crack Super Nova team for 1997, he had the equipment and the talent to take the F3000 title after a tremendous battle with Juan Montoya. Grand Prix teams had already been alerted to his ability and a highly promising F1 test for Jordan brought a testing contract with McLaren in 1998. Mercedes placed him alongside the experienced Klaus Ludwig in their CLK-GTR to contest the FIA GT championship and the pair duly shared the drivers crown after five wins in the ten-round series. 
Zonta now looks forward to a second year in Formula 1 with BAR. His philosophy is: being the best in everything I do. Dont bet against him reaching the very top in the future.";

By the late nineties only Panis and Jean Alesi represented la Belle France, and at the turn of the millennium Olivier, for the time being at least, can be removed from the list. 
Following the traditional karting, Pilote Elf and Formule Renault junior route, the quiet and impeccably mannered Panis emerged as champion in 1989 to earn a move into French F3. His first year, in a Dallara, brought fourth place in the championship, while in the second, despite taking five wins and six poles in a Ralt, he was narrowly beaten to the title by Christophe Bouchut. Olivier then took the well-trodden path to F3000 with the Apomatox team. It was to be a tough year struggling with the Lola chassis, but Panis still impressed enough to land the plum drive with DAMS for 1993. True to its reputation, this amazingly hard-fought series yet again saw the points spread evenly among the leading contenders, but it was Panis who finished at the head of the table in front of fellow Grand Prix aspirants Lamy, Coulthard, de Ferran and Beretta. 
Over the next two years, with the backing and confidence of Elf, Panis quietly established himself as a Grand Prix regular, shunting other hopefuls such as Comas, Bernard, Beretta and even younger chargers like Lagorce and Boullion into touch. 
Given his chance at Ligier, Olivier made a remarkably assured start to his Formula 1 career, highlighted by his second place in a German GP decimated by accidents. Paired with the experienced Brundle and Suzuki in 1995, he handled the politics of being a Frenchman in an increasingly cosmopolitan team with aplomb and his second place in the end-of-season race at Adelaide no doubt helped him survive the winter reshuffles. He was undisputed team leader in 1996, paired with the wealthy but inexperienced Pedro Diniz as the financially pressured outfit faced up to life as one of Grand Prix racings poorer relations. Despite the Ligier JS43 suffering from traction problems Panis got the best out of the car wherever he could, and was a shock winner of the rain-hit Monaco Grand Prix. Revelling in the slippery conditions, he drove quite superbly on the day and resisted the challenge of David Coulthards McLaren for much of the latter part of the race. 
With the takeover of Ligier by Alain Prost completed prior to the start of the 1997 season, Panis was the newly renamed Prost teams spearhead, and he kicked off the season in fine style, scoring the revamped organisations (and Bridgestones) first-ever points with a fifth place in Australia. 
Third in Brazil and second in Spain saw the Frenchman driving at the top of his form until disaster struck when he crashed violently in the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal. Both of his legs were badly broken and he spent several months recuperating. Happily he was fit enough to return before the end of the season, but it was very much a case of what might have been. 
The promise of 1997 gave way to gloom in 1998 when the first true Prost challenger was compromised by an overweight gearbox and incurable handling problems, and only late in the year was there a glimmer of hope for the frustrated Panis and his team-mate Jarno Trulli. 
Things did not improve much in 1999 and when Oliviers relationship with Alain Prost reached rock bottom by mid-year it became clear that his tenure with the team was finally over. Having put himself under the management of Keke Rosberg, the Frenchman was soon found alternative employment, signing a testing contract for McLaren, although plans for him to race in the revitalised German touring car series with Mercedes in 2000 have now been dropped.";

In mitigation, Marc was at this stage still studying at university, which naturally curtailed the amount of time he could devote to his racing career. 
Budget problems kept him out of action for much of 1996, but he managed to gain a place in the Pacific F3000 team at the start of 1997. Unfortunately an accident in the second round at Pau left Gene with a cracked vertebra, which sidelined him for a month, and when he was fit to return his place in the team had gone. Although he was able to find another berth with Nordic for a couple of races his season lay in tatters. 
So it was back to his day job as an accountant in Spain and competition in the less pressurised atmosphere of the Open Fortuna by Nissan single-seater series. Driving for Adrian Campos, Marc swept to a convincing championship win, chalking up six victories from twelve races. In truth there wasnt a huge amount of competition for him to beat, but it was to give his career a massive boost. 
With the Spanish communications giant Telefonica backing Minardi in 1999, Marc was suddenly a shock candidate for a place with the Faenza team and immediately impressed the Minardi hierarchy with his hard work and willingness to learn. 
Certainly he was not outclassed by his more experienced team-mate Badoer, and he had the great satisfaction of bringing his car into sixth place at the European Grand Prix. This single point pushed the little Italian team above the mega-rich British American Racing to ensure that, for one season at least, they were not bottom of the pile.";

At the time of writing, his Formula 1 prospects look bleak, the Dutchman having failed to make the most of the chances that have come his way. 
The young Jos might not have pursued the path of motor sport at all after he was hospitalised following a bad crash in his first-ever kart race as a ten-year-old. Soon, however, the passion to compete was all-consuming, and he quickly became one of Europes outstanding kart racers, before moving to Formula Opel Lotus in 1992. He demolished the opposition in the Benelux series, then turned his attention to the Euroseries, immediately putting the cat among the pigeons with his forceful and brilliant driving. 
Naturally much sought after, he opted to race a WTS Dallara-Opel in the German F3 championship in 1993 and cut a swathe through the opposition in this class as well, winning eight races on his way to the title. Victory in the Marlboro Masters at Zandvoort helped attract the Formula 1 teams to his door and a test at Estoril for Footwork was so impressive that Benetton immediately moved to sign him on a long-term contract. 
An injury to JJ Lehto meant that Verstappens debut was not long in coming. Being thrown in at the deep end as number two to Michael Schumacher is not the easiest way to start a Grand Prix career, but Jos did well in the first two Grands Prix before Lehto returned. After the Finns confidence had quickly been sapped, Verstappen was brought back into the team and soon made headline news worldwide when he escaped from a fiery inferno when his Benetton caught fire at a refuelling stop during the German GP. Luckily he suffered only minor burns and in the next race scored his first podium finish. His meteoric rise came to an abrupt halt when Benetton decided a proper learning season with Simtek was in order, but he once again caught the eye with some impressive qualifying performances in his short spell with the team before it folded. 
In 1996 the young Dutchman restarted his GP career at Arrows, and caused quite a stir in the early-season races when he took the unfancied car into the top half of the timing sheets. Inevitably, as the year wore on, Verstappen struggled to impress as the Footwork, lacking in development, was overhauled by others. A move to Tyrrell should have brought more reward, but the team were plainly uncompetitive in 1997, and the hard-charging Verstappen could only take satisfaction that he was mostly the equal of his team-mate Mika Salo. Ken Tyrrell was impressed enough to want to retain the Dutchmans services for the following year and, having sold out to Craig Pollock, the former team owner resigned from the organisation when Jos was passed over in favour of pay-driver Ricardo Rosset. Luckily another F1 chance soon presented itself when Verstappen replaced the out-of-favour Jan Magnussen in the Stewart line-up in mid-1998. In his half-season with the outfit Jos fared little better than his hapless predecessor, and it seems that there was friction with team owner Jackie Stewart. 
Harvey Postlethwaite certainly thought highly of Verstappens talents and employed him to help in the development of Hondas Grand Prix challenger. Sadly the former Tyrrell gurus untimely death brought proceedings to a halt, and contributed to an about-face by the Japanese car giant, which took the project to British American Racing. For Verstappen, it was a return to his fathers karting centre in Holland, where he was left tinkering with his beloved machines and waiting in hope for the phone call that might resurrect his career.";

He raced karts from 1980 to 1985, taking a German junior championship, before three seasons in German FF2000, where he finished runner-up in 1987. This set up a move into the German Opel Lotus Challenge the following year, and Heinz-Harald not only took the title but also scored a couple of wins in the GM Lotus Euroseries. 
It was in 1989 that motor racing aficionados worldwide really started to take an interest in the trio of talented youngsters, Wendlinger, Michael Schumacher and Frentzen, who were battling for the German F3 title. Eventually, the last two shared second place just one point adrift of Wendlinger, but their performances were such that all three were earmarked to join the Mercedes Benz Group C programme for 1990. In addition Heinz-Harald found long-term backing from Camel to join Eddie Jordan in F3000. 
It was now that his career began to stall; left in the third car at EJR and with no real experience, he struggled all year, and with the troublesome Lola in 91 things hardly improved. Worse was to follow ... Camel took their budget to Benetton with Schumacher for 1992, and Heinz-Harald was left high and dry without a drive of any sort. He agreed to race for March in 93, but wisely backed away and plumped instead to go to Japan to compete in F3000 for Super Nova, in place of the indisposed Volker Weidler. The time he spent there did a great deal to build his confidence, and when the chance of a test for Sauber came in the autumn of 1993 Frentzen was equipped to make the most of it. 
His first year in F1 saw Heinz-Harald assume the team leadership after Wendlingers accident and quickly become a top-six contender, despite the Saubers obvious limitations, and this quiet and unassuming man took another giant stride forward in 1995, working ceaselessly to push the Ford-engined car towards the front of the grid. In the second half of the season Frentzen put in some superb drives to enhance his rising reputation. That he had come to be so highly regarded in just two seasons of Formula 1 in a car not good enough to challenge the leaders showed the reservoir of talent which he possessed. 
Despite the introduction of the new Ford Zetec-R V10, the Germans 1996 season was something of an anti-climax, with Frentzen seeming less than fully committed when the Sauber C15 failed to come up to scratch. Williams, of course, had already made their move and controversially signed Frentzen to replace Damon Hill for the 1997 season. 
Life at Williams is never a bed of roses and it was to prove less than fertile ground for Frentzen, who failed to bloom in the harsh environment. A win at Imola and a string of podium finishes brought the runner-up position in the championship behind team-mate Jacques Villeneuve, but lurking in the background was the feeling that his contribution could, and should, have been much greater. Worse was to follow for 1998, which turned into something of a nightmare for the mild-mannered Frentzen. The new narrow-track and grooved-tyre regulations found the Williams FW20 wanting and Heinz-Harald seemed resigned to his number two status behind Villeneuve. 
He was prematurely written off by many, but not by Eddie Jordan, who swiftly moved to bring the German on board for the 1999 season. A superb second place at the opening race in Australia provided Heinz-Harald with an immediate and much-needed boost to his confidence and he simply never looked back. Team-mate Damon Hill was left floundering by Frentzens pace, and his smooth style and calmness under pressure brought two well-judged wins which, together with a further ten top-six finishes, earned an impressive third place in the championship table. More importantly, perhaps, Frentzen had regained his credibility as a top-rank driver.";
56;"Eddie Irvine";1;10.11.1965;"Ньютаунардс (Конлиг)";"Даун (Северная Ирландия)";"графство";"Edmund «Eddie» Irvine Jr.";"Эдди Ирвайн";"";"";"Eddie Irvines bold, but ultimately unsuccessful, attempt to wrest the drivers championship from Mika Hakkinen not only saved the 1999 season from McLaren domination but also gave the Ulsterman the platform to show the talents that had for so long been subjugated to the needs of Michael Schumacher. 
Many onlookers were surprised at his emergence, but Eddies early career had promised a great deal, from his beginnings in the British and Irish FF1600 series. Driving a works Van Diemen, he won both the RAC British and Esso FF1600 championships in 1987, amassing 14 victories, and to crown his year Irvine also took the Brands Hatch Formula Ford Festival in convincing style. Moving up to Formula 5 in 1988, Eddie found winning a tougher proposition; he managed eight top-three placings but just could not break the dominance of J J Lehto and Gary Brabham. 
His graduation to F3000 the following season with Pacific found the team struggling, but Irvine got stuck in and never gave up. His reward was a move to Eddie Jordans team in 1990 and he rapidly developed into a front-runner, winning at Hockenheim and finishing third in the championship. Subsequently opting to continue his career in the Japanese F3000 series, he finished sixth in the final table in 1991 and 1992, and was very unfortunate to lose the 1993 championship to Kazuyoshi Hoshino after scoring more points than the veteran. Highly thought of by Toyota, Irvine drove for the company in Japan in 1992 and also at Le Mans, both in 1993, when he was fourth and set fastest lap, and 1994, when he came second. 
Eddie was given his F1 chance by Jordan at Suzuka in 1993, and rarely can a Grand Prix debut have brought so much controversy. As, revelling in the tricky conditions, he battled with Damon Hill for sixth place, he first balked and then had the temerity to repass the race leader, Ayrton Senna, who was attempting to lap him; in the closing stages he punted Derek Warwick off to claim his first championship point; and then he suffered a physical and verbal assault from the irate Brazilian after the race. It certainly moved the self-assured Ulsterman to centre stage, if only for a weekend. 
Signed for a full season of Grand Prix racing with Jordan in 1994, Irvine was soon embroiled in further controversy. Blamed for a four-car pile-up in Brazil, he harshly received a one-race ban. Quite reasonably, Eddie appealed and was sent away with his punishment increased three-fold! A less resilient character than the Ulsterman may have suffered a loss of confidence, but he bounced back all the stronger, a late-season drive to fourth place at Jerez being the best of a number of fine displays. 
In 1995 Irvine matured even further to outshine team-mate Barrichello more often than not. His performances in qualifying were particularly impressive but it still came as a mild shock when it was announced that Eddie would be joining Michael Schumacher at Ferrari in 1996. 
This was to prove the chance of a lifetime for Irvine, who was astute enough to accept his subordinate role to the German in the team on the sound basis that a spell at Maranello could only improve his own standing as a driver. His first season brought little in terms of worthwhile finishes nor was he given sufficient testing to enable him to back his team leader as effectively as he would have wished, but he carved a comfortable and profitable niche for himself, wearing an air of casual indifference or open defiance depending upon his mood. 
The 1998 season saw an even more confident Eddie raise his game, and he not only became a reliably consistent points scorer but also had the look of a genuine contender for victory should the opportunity arise. However, few people anticipated that the opening race of 1999 at Melbourne would bring that first Grand Prix win and that he would then be sucked into the vortex of a thrilling championship battle with the McLarens of Hakkinen and Coulthard. Picking up Ferraris challenge after Schumachers unfortunate Silverstone accident, Irvine realistically assessed his situation and took the fight to the McLaren pair with great tenacity, and was predictably consummate in waging a war of mind-games. 
In the end, of course, Eddie came up just short and had to give best to Hakkinen in Japan. There was, by way of consolation, a multi-million-pound move to Jaguar for 2000 and the chance to emerge from Schumachers shadow and prove he has what it takes as a team leader in his own right.";

The champion was snapped up by Lotus, while Salo, despite six wins to his credit, was left without sufficient backing even to scrape up a ride in European F3000. 
It must have been a choker for the uninhibited Salo, who had an almost unbroken list of successes in karts and FF1600 behind him in Scandinavia, but at least he had the lifeline of employment in Japan testing and racing on behalf of Yokohama. Running on these tyres in the All-Japan F3000 championship failed to produce the most spectacular of results, but in his four-year stay in the Far East Mika built up a massive amount of experience. 
He was therefore ideally placed to step into a vacant seat at Lotus for the 1994 Japanese GP and took his big chance to shine in a poor car, finishing tenth in the appalling race conditions without once making an error. From forgotten man he was suddenly in demand, and when it was clear that Lotus had finally closed its doors Salo joined Tyrrell for the 1995 season. 
A sensational debut in Brazil could have yielded points but for his suffering cramp, and he spent the rest of the season generally overshadowing his team-mate Katayama. There were plenty of rough edges, and his driving tactics were sometimes a little questionable, but Mika plugged away in a disappointing car to take three points-scoring finishes in the last six races. The maturing Finn undoubtedly had the speed to go much further up the Grand Prix ladder, but after a bright start to the 1996 season he found himself wondering if he could even finish a race, let alone challenge for a worthwhile result, given the fragility of the Yamaha engine. 
Locked into a three-year deal with Tyrrell, Salo was joined in 1997 by the equally hungry Jos Verstappen and the young lions had customer Ford power, which increased reliability but at the price of straightline speed. When circumstances presented him with a chance to score points with the Tyrrell at Monaco, Mika drove a brilliant non-stop race to take fifth place and emphasise that a talent was largely being wasted. 
It was something of a sideways move for Salo when he switched to Arrows for 1998 to replace Damon Hill. For the Finn it was much the same scenario as at Tyrrell: tidy but none-too-quick machinery with questionable reliability. A fourth place was achieved at Monaco in the black car but no other top-six finishes were forthcoming. When Pedro Diniz defected to Sauber at seasons end, he took his massive sponsorship package with him, and this had far-reaching consequences for Salo, who found himself pushed out by Pedro de la Rosa and Toranosuke Takagi, who both came with substantial backing. 
This was to be a blessing in disguise if the Finn but knew it, for he was free to take over from Ricardo Zonta at BAR after the Brazilian had sustained a foot injury. Mika at least managed to bring the car to the finish in one of his three races before stepping down, and was then rapidly called back into action, this time with Ferrari. This was Salos big chance, and he certainly made an impression in the German Grand Prix when he had total control of the race before moving aside to let team-mate Eddie Irvine take the ten points in his championship quest. 
His selflessness no doubt played a big part in the Finns being offered a seat at Sauber for 2000. Midfield mediocrity may be all Salo has in prospect, but now at least he has the regular ride which is the minimum this talented driver deserves.";

Almost certainly the popular French driver would now be able to look back on more than just a single Grand Prix victory in what must be seen as a career that has failed to achieve anything like the success his natural talent demanded. 
Jean, who was born in Avignon of Sicilian descent, demonstrated his ability early in his career when in 1986 he shook the established order in French F5. Running his own Dallara-Alfa, Alesi scored two race wins, three second places and three other top-three finishes to claim the runner-up spot behind champion Yannick Dalmas. That this was achieved without the benefit of major-sponsor backing - so prevalent in the series - was not lost on the ORECA squad, who signed Jean to race for them in 1987. He duly took the teams fifth consecutive French F5 title, but only after a disastrous early season which eventually saw the troublesome Martini chassis replaced - at Jeans insistence - by a new Dallara 387, the switch allowing him to take six successive wins on his way to the crown. 
Naturally Alesi moved into the ORECA F3000 team for the following season but the campaign proved to be a huge disappointment for all concerned, Jean being particularly unhappy at the lack of rapport on the engineering side. Marlboros decision to back Lehto and Irvine for 1989 led to a switch to Eddie Jordans team and the pair got on famously. Not only was the F3000 championship won - albeit narrowly from Erik Comas - but Alesi stepped into the Tyrrell vacated by Michele Alboreto to score a sensational fourth place in the French Grand Prix on his F1 debut. An 18-month contract was quickly signed and Alesi set about building a reputation as a fast and fearless racer intimidated by nobody - as Senna would find at Phoenix and Berger at Monaco in 1990 - but one sometimes running at the ragged edge or beyond, as at Monza, where he spun out in a fruitless attempt to match the pace of the McLarens. 
rank Williams decided he liked Jeans style and a contract was signed for him to race the Williams-Renault in 1991. However, after protracted negotiations it was announced he would be driving for Ferrari instead. 
Initially he found the going tough, his relative lack of experience proving a handicap in a difficult team environment. There were drives of brilliance in 1992 - at Barcelona and Magny Cours, for example - but even more frustration in terms of solid results was to follow in 1993. Despite Ferraris relative lack of success, Alesi signed for a further two years at Maranello, hoping the restructuring programme would bring him the success he craved. In the event 1994 turned out to be a desperately disappointing year. His early season was disrupted by a back injury sustained in a testing accident. This caused him to miss two races, and his return to the wheel was punctuated by driver errors and engine failures. The Latin blood within him reached boiling point at Monza as that elusive first Grand Prix win disappeared when the gearbox was damaged at a refueling stop. 
Jeans final year with the Prancing Horse brought - after 91 races - an emotional and hugely popular win in Canada. Brilliant drives in Brazil and at the Nurburgring once again highlighted his mesmerising car control, but his volatility, surely such a factor in these performances, finally saw him fall out with Jean Todt. Finding himself surplus to requirements, he lost little time in negotiating a seat at Benetton for 1996. 
On paper his chances of success were good, and a serious World Championship bid lay in prospect. In the event it was the usual cocktail of brilliance (at Monaco, where he could have won) mixed with an equal measure of stupidity (needless shunts in Australia and Japan). The 1997 season saw much the same story and, despite some excellent drives (most notably at Monza), Alesi was left to contemplate a slide further down the grid after signing a two-year deal with Sauber. Predictably, perhaps, the first season brought optimism and some sparkling performances, but the second yielded only mounting frustration at midfield obscurity followed by discord when the team failed to progress. The now-veteran Alesi joins forces with Alain Prost for 2000. It will be interesting indeed to see if this potentially volatile partnership stays the course.";
63;"Mika Hakkinen";3;28.9.1968;"Вантаа (близ Хельсинки)";"Уусимаа (Южная Финляндия)";"провинция";;"Мика Хаккинен";"";"";"Mika has always seemed bound for great things. With the benefit of long-term sponsorship and the guiding hand of Keke Rosberg, he negotiated the slippery slope to the top in very short order and still showed the patience to bide his time when necessary. After sustaining very serious head injuries in practice for the Australian GP at the end of 1995, Hakkinen came back with his appetite undiminished and eventually fulfilled his early promise by taking successive World Championships with McLaren-Mercedes in 1998 and 1999. 
A multiple karting champion in his native Finland, winner of three FF1600 titles in 1987, and GM Lotus Euroseries champion in 1988, Hakkinen had a pretty impressive CV to take into the 1989 Formula 3 season. Initially things went wrong. Having opted to stay with the Dragon team that had served him so well in 1988, he found himself way off the pace, but he persevered and when he switched to the WSR squad for the prestigious Cellnet F3 race at the end of the season he promptly won it. 
A deal was then concluded for 1990 and Mika never looked back, winning a total of 12 races at home and abroad. He took the British F3 championship, and before the year was out had a Formula 1 seat with Lotus. In his first season in Grand Prix racing, the confident young Finn impressed everyone with his car control in a chassis that was never a match for the best scoring points in only his third race. The following season, with a much better car, the team on the up and Ford HB engines, Mika firmly established himself in the top echelon, extracting the very maximum from the sleek Lotus 107. 
Now came an unexpected chance that Hakkinen wisely grabbed. With Senna prevaricating over his contract at McLaren, Ron Dennis lost little time in signing Mika as cover in case the Brazilian should carry out his threat not to race. In the end Senna 
contested the full season, and Mika was left sitting on the sidelines, waiting patiently for his opportunity, which finally came when Michael Andretti headed back home. In his first race, in Portugal, Mika out-qualified his master, and lay third until he ran wide and into the barrier. In his next race, in Japan, he was more circumspect, settling for a career-best third place in wildly fluctuating weather and track conditions. 
For 1994, Hakkinen assumed the McLaren team leadership in the wake of Sennas departure for Williams. However, the optimism engendered by a new liaison with Peugeot soon evaporated and his year was spent in frustration which sometimes turned into desperation, such was his desire to succeed. Ill-advised first-corner moves at Monaco and Hockenheim saw him eliminated, the latter indiscretion earning him a one-race ban. A much-heralded partnership with Mercedes Benz for 1995 brought promise of a new dawn for McLarens sagging fortunes, but once more the team were never really on the pace, although Mika drove superbly in a handful of races, taking second places at Monza and Suzuka. His performance in Japan was all the more admirable since he had undergone an appendectomy only ten days earlier, missing the previous weekends Pacific GP. 
Less than a fortnight after that sparkling performance came disaster in Adelaide: Mika was very close to losing his life and only prompt action saved him. The fun-loving Finn made a miraculously swift return, and after a shaky start soon proved he had lost none of the blinding speed he had always shown in the past. Indeed the 1996 season was the one in which Mika established himself as a bona fide number one driver; all that was missing was the breakthrough Grand Prix victory that the driver and team had been working so hard to achieve over the past three years. 
That win came in the opening race of the 1997 season at Melbourne, but unfortunately for the Finn it was David Coulthards name that went into the record books. Undeterred, Mika continued to knock on the door, shrugging aside the heartbreak of a late, late retirement when leading the British Grand Prix to bounce back with more determination than ever. He had to wait until the seasons finale at Jerez before taking the top step of the podium, and in the event the victory was somewhat hollow in that both Jacques Villeneuve and David Coulthard allowed Hakkinen through to the chequered flag. 
By 1998, however, his time had come. After Coulthard had stood by a pre-race agreement to allow the Finn to take first place in the Australian Grand Prix, Mika then scorched away from his team-mate to begin a thrilling championship battle with Michael Schumacher. Wins in Brazil, Spain, Monaco, Austria and Germany were topped by perhaps his greatest triumph, at the Luxembourg Grand Prix, when he pulled out a top-drawer performance to defeat his Ferrari rival. His championship clincher in Japan was to be a much easier win after Schumacher had stalled his car at the start. 
Back-to-back titles are notoriously hard to achieve and being the hot favourite for a repeat championship seemed to take its toll on both McLaren and Hakkinen. Brilliant performances were interspersed with inexplicable lapses by both driver and team, who, it seemed, were going to lose the championship despite Schumachers enforced absence after his Silverstone shunt. 
In the end, Mikas fluctuating title battle with Eddie Irvine and Ferrari was won with a truly dominant performance in Japan. And, while there was some sympathy for the underdog Irishman who had run the Finn so close, the general consensus was that the right man had claimed the World Championship crown.";
64;"Tarso Marques";2;19.1.1976;"Куритиба";"Парана";"штат";"Tarso Anibal Sant'anna Marques";"Тарсо Маркес";"";"";"Following his apprenticeship in karting and Formula Opel Lotus, Marques made a good impression when he stepped up to the 1993 SudAm Formula 3 series with a Ralt-Mugen Honda. The ambitious Brazilian youngster headed to Europe to contest the F3000 championship the following season and garnered a fourth place at Magny Cours. A move to a seat in the crack DAMS team for 1995 put the fast but sometimes wayward Tarso in contention for F3000 championship honours, but he eventually had to settle for fifth in the standings with a win at Estoril to his credit. 
A chance to shine in Grands Prix came early in 1996 when Marques was entrusted with the Minardi for the two South American races. Although he immediately impressed, the Brazilian was consigned to a testing role with Bridgestone until a recall to the ranks came in mid-1997 when Trulli left to drive for Prost. Unfortunately, nothing startling was achieved in the tail-end car and Marques was left without a drive of any sort for 1998. 
However, a fabulous test for the Payton-Coyne team was to alert the CART community to the Brazilians undoubted speed, and he was given six races by Penske in 1999. The cars uncompetitiveness hampered Tarsos chances of making a big impact and it remains to be seen where his stop-start career will lead him in the future.";

He completed a year in the Sud-Am F5 series before heading to Europe in 1991, where he secured a seat in the crack West Surrey Racing team. A season spent alongside the very quick Rubens Barrichello and Jordi Gene highlighted his shortcomings, but a move to Edenbridge Racing in 1992 showed he had learned much. 
For 1993, Diniz jumped up to compete in F3000 with Forti Corse but was out of his depth. Staying on for 1994, he conjured up one fourth-place finish at Estoril, but the Brazilians performances, while showing some promise, failed to convince. 
Eyebrows were therefore raised when his name appeared on the 1995 F1 entry list paired with fellow countryman Roberto Moreno at Forti. In the event he was neat and tidy and proved evenly matched with his experienced colleague. However, the car was clearly uncompetitive and, with a massive personal sponsorship budget, Diniz lost no time in obtaining a drive for 1996 at Ligier, where his goal was to secure a championship point, which he achieved on two occasions. 
For 1997 Diniz (accompanied by his wedge of cash) was tempted away by Tom Walkinshaw to join his newly reconstructed Arrows team as number two to Damon Hill. Again he silenced the doubters with a number of more-than-respectable performances. He even managed to out-qualify and out-race the reigning World Champion at Spa, of all places, and took a career-best fifth place in the Luxembourg Grand Prix. For 1998 the Brazilian found himself paired with Mika Salo and again had his moments, interestingly scoring points at the two classic circuits of Monaco and Spa. 
It was patently obvious to Diniz that to climb further up the grid he needed a better car than Arrows had thus far provided, so he was on the move once more. Brushing aside threats of litigation for breach of contract, Pedro prepared to test himself against Jean Alesi at Sauber. Amazingly he outscored his team leader by three points to two, which proved nothing more than that, on this occasion, modest consistency paid more dividends than blinkered audacity. 
For 2000 Diniz remains a Formula 1 fixture, trying once more to convince the sceptics that he is worthy of a place on the grid on merit, rather than by dint of the vast millions which ease his way into the cockpit.";
68;"Johnny Herbert";1;25.6.1964;"Ромфорд";"Эссекс (Англия)";"графство";;"Джонни Херберт";"";"";"Perhaps Britains most talented young prospect of the eighties, Johnny Herbert has built a successful career for himself in the world of Grand Prix racing - indeed 1999 has just seen him take an unlikely but well-deserved win in the European Grand Prix to add to his emotional and hugely popular victories at Silverstone and Monza in 1995 - yet one wonders if the horrific crash at Brands Hatch in 1988 which interrupted his meteoric rise somehow robbed his career of an impetus which might have seen him be a true contender for the World Championship itself. 
Racing in karts from the age of ten, Herbert worked his way through the classes, taking numerous championships on the way, before graduating to FF1600 and winning the prestigious Brands Hatch Formula Ford Festival in 1985. Johnnys path then crossed that of Eddie Jordan, who took him into Formula 3 in 1987. Herbert won the title and a Benetton test, which led to an option to drive for the team in 1989, so it was a season of F3000 next, which started brilliantly with a win at Jerez, followed by a number of highly competitive drives before that fateful Brands accident. 
Johnny had the goal of reaching the grid in Brazil to make his debut for Benetton, and after months of painful rehabilitation he not only drove in Rio, but brought the car into fourth place. But as the year progressed it became clear that he was still handicapped by his injuries, and he was summarily replaced by the less talented Pirro. Now came a period when Johnny had to step down into Japanese F3000, take the occasional F1 ride and wait for another chance (an unexpected victory at Le Mans with Mazda in 1991 providing a highlight). 
Luckily his old mentor at Benetton, Peter Collins, was now busy reviving the fortunes of Lotus, and Herbert was very much the man he wanted for the job. Brought back into the team full-time early in 1991, Herbert repeatedly showed he had the talent to win but, unfortunately, not the car. Locked into a contract at Lotus, Herbert was left trapped and frustrated as the team struggled on against overwhelming odds during the 1994 season. Johnny lost heart and, despite a morale-boosting fourth place on the grid at Monza, his relationship with team boss and father figure Peter Collins soured to the point that a split was inevitable. 
Both parties must have been relieved when Flavio Briatore bought out his contract in September that year, for not only did Collins have some much-needed finance to stagger on at Lotus, but Johnny had a contract which saw him through to the end of 1995. Initially he was placed at Ligier, but after a fine performance at Jerez he was whisked into the Benetton team in the hope that he might assist Schumachers title bid. 
As mentioned before, 1995 was the year that Johnny found tangible success; indeed, apart from his two wins, his consistency brought him within a whisker of taking third place in the World Championship. Unfortunately his status at Benetton was very much that of the number two to Schumacher, and his gripes to the press after a disappointing showing in the Belgian GP could not have helped his cause. 
Not retained at seasons end, Herbert found a ride at Sauber and, after a somewhat frosty start when his experience was underutilised in testing, he gradually won the teams confidence, especially after team-mate Frentzen seemed to lose his motivation. Third place at Monaco was the best result in a year littered with retirements, but despite the loss of the Ford engine deal to Stewart Herbert had done enough to earn a new two-year contract with the Swiss constructor. Johnny was now the teams mainstay and was charged with the task of developing the new Sauber C16 with its Petronas (nee Ferrari) engine largely on his own. 
The car was a capable points scorer but never a likely winner, and the ever-jovial Herbert made the best of his situation. Things changed for the worse in 1998 with the arrival of Jean Alesi. Simply, the two drivers failed to gel and Herbert appeared to be worn down as much by the Frenchmans histrionics as by his undeniable edge in speed on the track. 
He was considered a touch fortunate to secure a two-year deal with Stewart Grand Prix beginning in 1999, but after a quiet first half to the season Johnny picked up the pace and duly supplied the teams aforementioned maiden Grand Prix win. Another superb drive in Malaysia gave Herbert a further boost to his confidence as he prepared to welcome Eddie Irvine on board as his new team-mate in the restructured Jaguar team for 2000.";

Conversely, off the track he is low-key, and is of a retiring and shy disposition. 
After a brilliant karting career and a season in Formula Toyota, Takagi was picked by TOMS to succeed Jacques Villeneuve in their F3 squad when he was aged just 18 back in 1993. He caught the eye of Nakajima, who gave him a chance to race in his F3000 team late the following year. 
Three seasons were then spent in Formula Nippon, where he was a regular top-six runner and an occasional winner. The 1997 campaign also saw the Japanese driver clock up over 2000 km of testing in preparation for his inclusion in the Tyrrell line-up the following year. 
Unfortunately he stepped into a team that was going through the motions, having been purchased by British American Racing. However, the year gave him a useful opportunity to learn the circuits and provided a good platform to build on when he took his sponsorship to Arrows for 1999. As at Tyrrell, Takagi impressed with a fair turn of speed but as often as not was found wanting when it came to putting everything together in the races. 
One day, surely, a superstar driver will emerge from the Far East. On the basis, admittedly, of two years spent in poor cars, Takagi appears to be just the latest in a long line of Japanese hopefuls, and it seems that he will be returning to Formula Nippon with the Nakajima team in 2000.";
70;"Luca Badoer";7;25.1.1971;"Монтебеллуна";"Венето";"область";;"Лука Бадоер";"";"";"Badoer was regarded as something of a prodigy when, aged only 19, he made his mark in Italian Formula 3 by winning the final round of the 1990 season ahead of championship contenders Colciago and Zanardi. 
Naturally all eyes were on the former Italian karting champion from Montebelluna the following season and, after a quiet start in the early rounds, Luca reeled off four wins in a row amid growing acrimony as rival teams questioned the legality of his car. In fact the last of these victories was wiped out due to the team running a non-scrutineered tyre and Badoers season never recovered thereafter. 
He had done enough, however, to move up to F3000 for 1992 and, at the wheel of the superbly engineered Team Crypton Reynard, Luca was a convincing champion, winning three of the early rounds and overcoming the effects of a nasty shunt at Spa to clinch the title with another victory at Nogaro. 
The slightly built Badoer then found himself pitched into the big time with the newly formed Lola Scuderia Italia team for 1993. The season was a fiasco with the car floundering at the back of the grid and the only question to be answered at most of the early Grands Prix was which of the two unfortunate drivers - Luca or Michele Alboreto - would fail to qualify. With the team folding after the Portuguese GP, Badoer was left looking for a drive for 1994 and an unimpressive winter test for Benetton left him out in the cold. 
Despite this setback Badoer was back in business with Minardi the following season, the little Faenza team pluckily picking up the pieces in spite of their devastating loss to Ligier of a projected works Mugen engine deal. Running customer Ford V8s meant the drivers were consigned to the grids lower reaches and the pursuit of the occasional point, but Luca managed to stay on board while the veteran Martini was dropped in mid-season. With his replacement, the well-sponsored Pedro Lamy, proving evenly matched with the shy and quiet Milanese driver, Badoer was forced to take his chances with back-markers Forti Corse in 1996. 
It was a gamble which failed to pay off when the struggling team collapsed in financial ruin by mid-season, leaving Badoer largely unemployed (with the exception of a couple of sports car outings in a GT Lotus) over the next eighteen months. 
In 1998 he won the role of Ferrari test driver, which precluded any chance of a return to Grand Prix racing, but a year later he was allowed to rejoin the Minardi family to resurrect his Grand Prix career. 
It was to be a season of huge disappointments for Luca, who suffered a broken wrist in a testing accident at Fiorano and was then devastated to be passed over by Ferrari after Michael Schumacher had broken his leg at Silverstone. To add to the drivers woes, a fourth place and three World Championship points slipped away at the European Grand Prix when his Minardis gearbox failed. Badoer was left in tears beside his stricken car, one of the saddest sights of the 1999 season.";

Sadly, there was to be no happy ending, as a cruel epilogue found the Italian all but crushed after a nightmare return to Grand Prix racing with Williams in 1999 which yielded not a single points finish, having gloried in three seasons of almost unbroken success racing for Chip Ganassi in the CART series. 
The first chapter in the career of this untypically quiet and unassuming Italian began with seven seasons spent racing karts before he contested the national Formula 3 series in 1988. His promise shone through the following year but his Racing for Italy Ralt RT33 was handicapped when a change to unleaded fuel in mid-season hobbled his Toyota engine and his results inevitably suffered. However, switching to a Dallara chassis in 1990, Alessandro finished second in the championship just three points adrift of Roberto Colciago, winning two of the series 12 rounds. 
Having made an inauspicious debut in F3000 at the tail-end of the 1989 season, nothing much was expected of Zanardi when he took his place in the new II Barone Rampante team for the start of the 1991 campaign. Extensive pre-season testing gave the Italian an early advantage, but despite victories at Vallelunga and Mugello he eventually lost the championship to the more consistent finishing record of Christian Fittipaldi. Not that it really mattered, for by this time Zanardi had been chosen to fill the Jordan seat vacated by Michael Schumacher for the final three races of the season. His hopes of a place in the Tyrrell line-up for 1992 were dashed when the team opted for de Cesaris, but he secured a testing contract with Benetton and ultimately made three unhappy appearances for Minardi in place of his former F3000 adversary Fittipaldi, who had injured his back. 
Alessandro was offered a chance to prove himself in 1993 when Mika Hakkinen left Lotus for McLaren, and Peter Collins was to be pleased with the Italians early form. He drove a storming race at Monaco, where he was unlucky to miss the points, and his contribution to the development of the teams highly complex active suspension programme drew warm praise, but his season came to a premature end after an extremely violent 150 mph accident at Spas notorious Eau Rouge which finished with his car destroyed and Zanardi in hospital with severe concussion. While he recovered from this shaking, he was rested in favour of Pedro Lamy for the remaining Grands Prix. The Portuguese hot-shot retained the ride for the 1994 season, although Zanardi was kept on in the role of test driver. As fate would have it, Lamy was subsequently badly injured in a testing accident at Silverstone, putting Alessandro back in for the balance of a dispiriting season as the once great Team Lotus heaved its dying breath. 
Zanardi was forced to sit out the 1995 season, save for an occasional Lotus GT drive, but at the end of the year he secured a deal to compete in the Indy Car series with Target/Chip Ganassi Racing after glowing recommendations from Adrian Reynard and Rick Gorne. Alex adapted to CART in sensational manner. The brilliant Italian won 15 races from his 51 starts and claimed successive PPG Cup championships in 1997 and 1998. It is all the more perplexing, therefore, that, thus far, he has been unable to translate his considerable skills to any telling effect in a Formula 1 car. At the time of writing his place at Williams seems under threat, but if he keeps his seat perhaps a revitalised figure will reappear. Certainly no one would begrudge him another chance.";

Sadly, of course, his illustrious father has not been able to offer him the benefit of his experience, but it is to Damons great credit that, once he had decided on a career in motor sport, he progressed entirely on his own merits. There can have been no one in the F1 paddock who begrudged him his success when, in 1996, he emulated his father in winning the World Championship. 
In fact, at first he was more interested in bikes than cars and made his competition debut on two wheels, which led him into a job as a despatch rider while he worked on his fledgling career. After a brief taste of Formula Ford at the end of 1983, Hill found himself drawn into the world of motor racing and, with the help of Brands Hatch supremo John Webb in the form of free tuition and a little promotion, he went racing seriously in 1985, enjoying a very competitive year of Formula Ford. His elevation to F3 for 1986 with Murray Taylor Racing may have been a little premature, but he finished ninth in the championship and then proved himself in the formula during a two-year spell at Intersport, winning splendidly at Zandvoort and Spa in 1987 and taking two more victories in 1988, including the prestigious Grand Prix support race at Silverstone. 
Damon then moved up to F3000 for 1989 and gave a good account of himself in the troubled Footwork before switching to Middlebridge the following year, when luck was not on his side in terms of results but more importantly he established himself as a genuine racer, capable of beating anyone in the field. A third year of F3000 in 1991 should have brought some real success at last but his Lola was no match for the Reynards and his first win remained elusive. There was, however, the consolation of a Williams testing contract, and the following year his work for the team helped ensure that the damage to his reputation arising from a calamitous half-season with Brabham, when he managed to qualify only twice, was merely superficial. So impressed was Patrick Head with his contribution that he was to be Damons strongest advocate when the chance of a Grand Prix drive with the team in 1993 arose. 
The way he handled his first year in a top team was exemplary in every respect. Unfazed by a couple of early gaffes at Kyalami and Imola, Hill pushed team leader Alain Prost harder and harder as the season wore on, while remaining acutely aware of the delicate political situation within the team. The fact that he won three Grands Prix was a bonus, his drive at Spa when he withstood severe pressure from Schumacher demonstrating that he had the stuff of which real winners are made. In 1994 he faced his biggest test with the arrival of Ayrton Senna. Tragically, within three races, Damon was facing the task of rebuilding shattered morale at Williams in the way his father had done at Lotus in 1968. In Damons case, he still had comparatively little experience and rose to the challenge magnificently. Nigel Mansells return in France prompted Hill to raise his game and push back the veterans claim to a full-time seat alongside him, then at Silverstone came a win in the British Grand Prix, a triumph made so special because it is a race Graham never won. 
In a season of drama and controversy, Damon took advantage of Schumachers disqualifications and enforced absence through suspension to close the gap enough to enable him to still win the championship. A superb drive in the wet at Suzuka was worthy of the German at his best, and it was all to play for in Adelaide. The manner in which the title was decided when Schumacher bounced back off the wall into Hills path was unsatisfactory to say the least, and his critics thought Hill should have avoided the situation. In any event, the title was lost, but Damons exemplary reaction in the aftermath spoke volumes for him as a person. 
The slate was wiped clean for 1995 and with the latest Williams FW17 in formidable form Hill set out on the championship trail with renewed vigour. A potential victory in Brazil was lost with suspension failure, but two consecutive wins seemed to indicate that the Englishman was on course for the title. Unfortunately Schumacher and Benetton had other ideas and Damon soon found himself on the ropes as the German ruthlessly exploited every weakness in the Williams armour. It was not until Hungary that the tide was stemmed, but, just as in boxing, winning occasional rounds does not win the fight and, despite his dominant performance in the final race at Adelaide, this World Championship bout went to Schumacher on points by a comfortable margin. 
When you have a multi-million-dollar contract and you drive for one of the worlds leading Grand Prix teams, then expectations are naturally high, as Hill had found during the two seasons he had been leading the Williams challenge. For such a polite and genuinely decent individual it must have been hurtful to have been thrown more brickbats than bouquets by a despicable element of the press, who lay waiting to pounce on any error with glee. It goes with the territory, they would say, but the treatment meted out to him at times during this period was disgraceful. 
Undoubtedly the 1996 season was Damons best-ever chance of taking the championship and with the advantage of his major rivals bedding down in new teams, and a rookie partner in Jacques Villeneuve, he could have no excuses if he failed. In the event, of course, mission was accomplished, with the popular Englishman winning eight of the sixteen races to pip his team-mate to the crown. The only shadow across his season was the decision by Frank Williams to dispense with his services in favour of Heinz-Harald Frentzen, leaving Damon with no chance to secure a top ride in 1997. 
So, after protracted negotiations with Jordan, Hill threw in his lot with Tom Walkinshaw at Arrows amid much brave talk of winning races. In the event he very nearly did, a superb drive in Hungary bringing second place when the car hit trouble on the penultimate lap. Otherwise it was a different story as the unfancied team struggled to make an impact, with Damon and his ambitious employer failing to see eye to eye. After negotiations with both McLaren and Prost, Hill joined up with Eddie Jordan for 98, tempted by a healthy retainer and the prospect of Mugen Honda-powered cars. At first it seemed like a huge mistake for all concerned, Hill struggling to make any impact in a poorly developed car, and it wasnt until the air was cleared in mid-season that things moved in the right direction. Fourth places at Hockenheim and the Hungaroring preceded the now famous wet-race win at Spa with which Damon was finally able to realise Eddie Jordans dreams of victory. 
Grand Prix racing has little room for sentiment, however, as Hill was soon to find in 1999 when he was comprehensively overshadowed by his new team-mate Heinz-Harald Frentzen. So unhappy was Damon with his performances in the new generation of Formula 1 car that he contemplated immediate retirement after a miserable showing in the French Grand Prix. As it transpired, he continued in tentative fashion until the seasons end. Physically, Damon had emerged unscathed but, sadly, his reputation had received a severe bruising.";

His performances earned him a seat in the Apomatox-run Prost Junior Team for 1998 and he kicked off his F3000 career with a superb win in the wet at Oschersleben. His season slid away somewhat after that, but he retained his place for 1999. 
Before the series got under way Sarrazin found himself elevated to the Grand Prix ranks when Minardi called him up at short notice to deputise for the injured Luca Badoer. With no testing, the Frenchman acquitted himself extremely well on his Grand Prix debut, but his race ended dramatically when his car suffered a suspension failure. 
Back in F3000, Stephane again took a single win at the Hungaroring, but it was the series champion Nick Heidfeld who was chosen for the vacant Prost Grand Prix seat for 2000. It had been thought that the Frenchman was being groomed for this place, and a disappointed Sarrazin has elected to take over Heidfelds prized West Competition drive to compete for a third year in the F3000 series.";

In the end he had to be content with a single win and numerous placings as Jan Magnussen swept all before him. The Brazilian moved up to F3000 in 1995 with few expecting him to figure among the front-runners, especially as he was partnered in the Super Nova line-up by the highly experienced Vincenzo Sospiri. In the event he proved almost the equal of his team leader in terms of speed and eventually took the runner-up slot behind the Italian. 
Ricardos performances brought a drive at Arrows in 1996 where he was initially well off the pace of his teammate Jos Verstappen, but he proved more impressive after a mid-season heart-to-heart with the team management. He then threw in his lot with Sospiri once more as Eric Broadley launched a brave but ultimately foolhardy attempt to return Lola to the Grand Prix grids in 1997. The debacle left Rosset with nothing but a testing contract at Tyrrell to fill his time and the budget to negotiate a seat in the team for 1998.

He then took the brave decision to chance his arm in the Formula Opel Lotus Euroseries for two seasons in 1990-91, but endured a thin time of it and returned to Japan for 1992 to race for Satoru Nakajima in both F3000 and Formula 3. 
This over-ambitious schedule proved to be his undoing, and he decided to concentrate solely on Formula 3 in 1993 in a bid to restart his now flagging career. Helped greatly by Mugen Honda boss Hirotoshita Honda, he moved back up to the All-Japan F3000 championship the following year and gradually worked his way to the front end of the grid. 
His connections were crucial in his placement in the Prost team for 1997 where at first he was all at sea. Certainly Alain Prost gave little time to his number two driver and was pushing hard to drop him from the team, but in the end Mr Honda stood firm and his protege was safe. Accepting the situation, Alain then spent some time helping Shinji to come to terms with Formula 1, with the result that his performances improved no end in the second half of the season. 
For 1998 Nakano was found a seat at Minardi and did a tidy job under difficult circumstances, but not unnaturally nothing in the way of startling results was achieved.

Certainly Jackie Stewart regarded him as a potential World Champion of the future. Sadly, thus far that dazzling promise has remained largely unfulfilled and Magnussen is no longer on the Formula 1 team managers shortlists. 
A hugely successful karting career which culminated in the senior world crown in 1990 set him on the path to the top of motor sport. Without any sponsorship to speak of, Jan drove in FF1600 in 1992 and not only took that title, but capped it with a stunning display to win the prestigious end-of-year Formula Ford Festival at Brands Hatch. A year in the Vauxhall Euroseries had its ups and downs, but still Magnussens innate talent shone through, and two late-season F3 drives with PSR cemented his place for 1994, leading to the aforementioned success. 
Signed by McLaren as a test driver, Jan also joined Mercedes for their DTM/ITC programme, which represented a great opportunity for the young Dane to work with a major manufacturer. Initially he hankered for single-seater action, but after his season was interrupted by a broken leg, sustained in a bizarre paddock accident when he fell off his scooter, Magnussen returned more fully focused, eventually taking second place to Bernd Schneider in the ITC series. 
At the end of the season, he gave an assured performance on his Grand Prix debut at the Pacific GP, but he was forced to continue in the Mercedes ITC team in 1996. A chance of single-seater action came in the form of a few Indy Car outings, initially with Penske, replacing the injured Paul Tracy, and then with Hogan, filling in for Emerson Fittipaldi. The heavy Penske chassis did him no favours but, given his lack of testing, Jan did a solid enough job. 
When Paul and Jackie Stewart made the transition to Formula 1 for 1997 Jan was given the second seat alongside Rubens Barrichello, but it was to be a traumatic debut season for the Dane, who failed to match the pace of his more experienced team-mate. Fortunately, as the year wore on he finally seemed to be getting to grips with the task and he was kept on for 1998 in the hope that he could make the big breakthrough. In the event Magnussens confidence seemed to be eroded by the teams criticism of his perceived lack of performance, and after scoring his first-ever championship point in Montreal he was summarily dropped in favour of Jos Verstappen. 
Looking to reinvigorate his flagging career, Magnussen has since taken his opportunity to shine with Panoz Racings sports roadster in the American Le Mans Series, as well as reviving his CART prospects in 1999 with a seven-race stint for Pat Patrick.";
78;"Gerhard Berger";22;27.8.1959;"Воргль";"Тироль";"земля";;"Герхард Бергер";"";"";"When Gerhard Berger finally hung up his helmet at the end of the 1997 season, he was really the last of the generation of superstars whose F1 careers dated back to the turbo era of the mid-eighties. Indeed he was slightly unfortunate to have had to pit himself against such giants of the sport as Senna, Prost, Piquet and Mansell over an eight-season spell between 1986 and 1995, otherwise his tally of ten wins could easily have been doubled. 
With a limited racing background firstly in Alfas and then in the German and European Formula 3 series, Berger had gained a reputation as a fast and safe driver who, above all, brought his car home to the finish when he breezed into the ATS team towards the end of 1984. His sixth place at Monza was sufficient indication that here was a rough diamond waiting to be polished, and a close-season accident which left him with broken vertebrae in his neck was not enough to prevent him from lining up at the start of the 1985 season in the Arrows-BMW team. At first Gerhard struggled somewhat alongside the quiet and talented Thierry Boutsen, but his aggressive driving style began to pay dividends in the second half of the season. 
Benetton were running BMW engines in 1986 and Bergers connections with the German company helped him to a place in the team, but he was soon to prove the wisdom of his selection with some eye-catching drives, especially when the Pirelli tyres were working well. After disappointment in Austria came his first Grand Prix win in Mexico and, on the not-too-distant horizon, a contract with Ferrari for 1987. 
Despite a hesitant beginning, Gerhards natural ebullience was quickly apparent and, after throwing away a victory in the Portuguese GP, he won the end-of-season Japanese and Australian races. In 1988 McLaren-Honda were utterly dominant, but Berger never gave up and a lucky win at Monza was just reward for perhaps his best-ever year. However, his final season at Maranello was distinctly low-key. Psychologically outgunned by Nigel Mansell, and striving to shake off the effects of a horrendous crash at Imola, he picked up a win at Estoril almost unnoticed before joining McLaren on a three-year contract to partner Ayrton Senna. 
Initially it was a morale-sapping experience, as he struggled in his stellar team-mates trail. He had difficulty fitting into the cockpit and was sometimes guilty of over-taxing his tyres, but gradually he got to grips with the situation at McLaren to become a perfect foil for Senna both on and off the track. Grand Prix wins came here and there; some were lucky and others well earned, with his final race for the team being perhaps his best, when his finely judged tactics brought him victory in Adelaide. 
Enticed by a reputedly massive retainer, Gerhard rejoined Ferrari for 1995, but endured a pretty torrid year adapting to active suspension, which he obviously disliked. Worryingly, he was involved in a number of alarming on-track incidents and claimed but a single podium finish. If he thought he could write it off as just a bad dream, then the start of the following year was to become a nightmare. Second place in the Pacific GP showed that Ferrari were at last back on course towards winning again, but then came the deaths of his close friends Ratzenberger and Senna at Imola. It must have been utterly devastating for Gerhard, who could easily have decided not to continue racing. However, after a week of soul-searching, he carried on with the sport he loves so much. His subsequent win at Hockenheim ended a dry spell of nearly four years for Ferrari, and was welcomed by all followers of the sport. 
As Ferrari continued their restructuring in search of the holy grail of the World Championship, Gerhard forged a good relationship with new team boss Jean Todt. He worked diligently and selflessly in Maranellos cause, and certainly the results achieved in 1995 did not reflect his true level of performance throughout the year. He could have won at Imola and Monza, but in the end had to be content with six third-place finishes. Gerhard has always been a team player, but could be excused for feeling unhappy at being pushed to the margins with the arrival of Michael Schumacher in 1996. Understandably the chance to partner Jean Alesi once more, this time at Benetton, seemed like his best option. 
Berger was to face a testing start to his Benetton career as he adapted to the nervous-handling car, but typically he worked away tirelessly and was rewarded by a second place at Silverstone. It could have been even better at Hockenheim a fortnight later, when a blown engine robbed him of victory with only a couple of laps remaining. What proved to be Gerhards final season was then blighted by a sinus problem which caused him to miss three races, followed by the death of his father in an air accident. That he came back to deliver a superb performance in winning the German Grand Prix showed his doubters that he could not yet be written off. However, at seasons end he decided to call time on a career which had spanned 210 races to take up a position as head of motor sport with BMW as they prepared for a Grand Prix return in 2000.";

However, Nicola has at least had the satisfaction of an opportunity to show his prowess at Ferrari when, standing in for the indisposed Jean Alesi, he took a splendid second place behind Schumacher in the San Marino GP at Imola in 1994. 
Larinis first win in a racing car came in a Fiat Abarth in 1984, and later that season he switched to Italian F3, qualifying fourth fastest for his first race. Driving a Martini-Alfa Romeo the following year he won two races and finished sixth in the championship. Taken under the wing of Enzo Coloni, Nicola upstaged his team leader Marco Apicella to win the 1986 Italian F3 championship in a Dallara before briefly moving into Formula 3000 with the rival Forti Corse team. 
Coloni then gave him his Grand Prix debut at the end of 1987, before he joined Osella for a couple of character-building seasons where he never gave less than 100 per cent. After an unhappy season with Ligier in 1990, Nicola threw in his lot with the ambitious but ill-starred Modena team, which soon foundered. Given a testing contract by Ferrari to develop their active suspension system, Larini re-established his reputation as a class driver by winning the 1992 Italian touring car championship for Alfa Romeo. His stock was to rise even higher in 1993 when he moved with Alfa into the high-profile German series, regularly destroying the opposition with some brilliant drives to take the DTM title as well. The next three seasons saw Mercedes and Opel break Alfas dominance and winning became a much tougher proposition, but Larini remained not only a popular and formidable competitor, but also undoubtedly one of the categorys star attractions. 
His continuing role as Ferrari test driver led to a Grand Prix return in 1997 when he was given a seat at Sauber. But, after he had scored a point in his first race, Larinis dream opportunity turned into a nightmare and he was summarily dropped amidst some unsavoury mud-slinging by both sides. Relieved to be out of a team in which he claimed the ambience was terrible, Nicola has returned to Alfa Romeo to race their 156 in the Italian Super Touring championship.";
80;"Ukyo Katayama";9;29.5.1963;"Токио";"Токио (Канто)";"префектура";;"Укио Катаяма";"";"";"This diminutive Japanese driver first ventured to Europe some time before he entered Grand Prix racing with Larrousse in 1992, for he tried his hand at Formule Renault in France in 1986 and the French Formula 3 series in 1987 after winning junior 1600 single-seater championships at home, taking the Tsukuba class B title in 1983 and the Suzuka FFJ 1600 crown in 1984. 
From 1988 he concentrated on racing in his national F3000 series, finally becoming champion in 1991, though he did come over to drive the uncompetitive Footwork briefly at the beginning of 1989. 
Given his F1 opportunity, Katayama was certainly committed. A possible first World Championship point was lost in Canada when he buzzed the engine, but his lack of strength and stamina seemed to count against him. With the faith of his sponsor Cabin intact, Ukyo moved to Tyrrell with Yamaha engines for 1993. Sadly the season was not a happy one, with the promise of the new V10 being compromised by the shortcomings of the chassis, and poor Katayama was involved in a seemingly endless catalogue of spins in a desperate attempt to make up for its failings. 
Just about everyone was writing off the little Japanese in terms of a Grand Prix career, but he blossomed in 1994. The new Tyrrell 022 was a much better chassis and taking fifth place in the seasons opening race at Interlagos can have done his confidence no harm. Despite the fact that he scored points on only two more occasions that year, his performances deserved more. He qualified fifth and ran in third at Hockenheim before throttle trouble, and then put in two storming drives at Monza and Jerez which went unrewarded. 
Katayamas standing in the Grand Prix fraternity had risen immensely after his splendid season so it must have been crushingly disappointing for Ukyo to be cast back into the role of also-ran once more in 1995, when Tyrrell failed to make the progress they expected. It must also be said that the arrival of Mika Salo certainly placed him under pressure. 
Ukyo stayed with the team for a fourth season in 1996, largely, it is thought, because of the substantial backing of Mild Seven. His form was more competitive, but health problems eventually blunted his motivation, especially after a dispiriting run of retirements in mid-season. It was surprising, therefore, when he decided to continue in F1 with Minardi in 1997, but given the need to adapt to the different language and culture he performed respectably. Tellingly, though, Ukyo was outshone by his novice team-mate Jarno Trulli and he came to the conclusion that it was time to step down and let a younger Japanese driver carry the hopes of his nation. 
Katayama has since spent more of his time on his other passion of mountain-climbing, but he still races for Toyota, taking second place in both the Le Mans 24 Hours and the Fuji 1000 Km in 19C9 with their potent GT-One prototype.";

It was a situation which the polite and personable Italian had known before, but it was galling for him nonetheless to have to settle for a testing contract with Jordan before a similar role with Ferrari led to another Grand Prix opportunity with Sauber. 
With a racing background (his family produced World Championship-winning motor cycles), Morbidelli raced karts from 1981 to 1986 before moving into Italian F5. Although he was certainly quick he was prone to accidents, which spoiled his 1988 season, but the following year he deservedly claimed the crown with his Forti Corse Dallara, earning a testing contract with Ferrari. 
The 1990 season saw him make a brief unscheduled Grand Prix debut for Dallara in place of the indisposed Pirro, before he concentrated on his planned F3000 campaign with Forti, which got off to a slow start. Once he got to grips with the Lola he scored a fine win at Enna and, with Paolo Barilla out of favour at Minardi, Gianni finished the season back in Formula 1 with the luxury of a contract in his pocket for a full season with the Faenza team (and Ferrari power) in 1991. The campaign failed to live up to expectations, but Gianni impressed enough for Ferrari to draft him in to replace the departed Prost in Australia, where he finished sixth in the rain-shortened race to earn a priceless half-point. 
He returned to Minardi in 1992, but the season was spent in the mire once more as they struggled to develop their Lamborghini-powered car. Without the necessary sponsorship to retain his place, Morbidelli then found himself dumped and was left to race in the Italian touring car championship with an Alfa Romeo. Luckily Jack Oliver had faith in Morbidellis abilities and drafted him into his Footwork team to renew his Grand Prix career in 1994. With customer Cosworth power the team were never in the hunt for major honours, but Gianni scored three priceless points to help keep his seat as pay-drivers hovered in the hope Oliver would take their money. 
So highly did Oliver think of Morbidelli that he retained his services in 1995 as team leader, no doubt assisted by the arrival of Taki Inoue, who brought much-needed finance. Sixth place in Canada was a bonus, but within another race Morbidelli was forced onto the sidelines as Max Papis bought his way in. Fortunately for Oliver, he was able to recall Gianni for the final three races and was of course rewarded with that podium finish which was the teams best result since 1989. 
Morbidellis reinstatement to the Grand Prix ranks with Sauber in 1997 came after Nicola Larinis bust-up with the team and Gianni was to find out that the number two seat in the Swiss outfit was no easy berth. Any chance of making an impression was stymied when he broke his arm badly in a testing accident, which forced him out for three races, and the season ended with another injury after a practice crash in Japan. 
Looking for a fresh challenge in 1998, Gianni turned to touring cars, driving for Volvo in the BTCC. By his own admission, he found it difficult to adapt to front-wheel drive but he was not the first ex-Grand Prix driver to fail to adjust to the demands of this specialised form of racing.";

Norberto could well have grabbed a seat at Sauber at the beginning of 1996 had it not been for a neck injury sustained in an accident at the end-of-year F3 Macau GP in 1995. Instead, he had to be content with the test-driver role with the Swiss team and headed out to Japan to compete in Formula Nippon. 
During his three seasons in the Far East Fontana was, predictably, a front-runner. He won four times, but the championship itself was to prove elusive and, with his ultimate goal a place on the Formula 1 grid, Norberto opted to return to Europe in 1999 to contest the FIA F3000 series.

Blindingly fast in pre-season testing, Pedro suffered a shock when the racing began and he struggled to qualify, but a switch of teams soon helped restore his confidence and he ended the season strongly by winning the final round of the German series, thus ensuring a move to replace champion Barrichello in the Draco Racing team for 1991. He was out of the traps with a succession of wins to build up such a healthy points cushion that he could even afford to have a couple of shunts at Spa and Imola on his way to the championship. 
With sound backing and shrewd management, Pedro opted for a season of German Formula 3 for 1992 and this was the year that he really came to prominence. Totally dominating proceedings in his WTS Reynard-Opel, he won 11 races in the 26-round series and underlined his mastery when he also won the big Marlboro Zandvoort meeting. 
A year in F3000 furthered his reputation as a very quick - but sometimes erratic - driver and some of his track manners were dubious to say the least. He won one race, at Pau, and remained in contention for the title until the final round when a collision cost him his chance. By now he had been called into the Lotus line-up at Monza to replace the unfit Zanardi. Lamy had a tough baptism but, with the backing of Portuguese sponsors, secured a full-time ride with the team for 1994. 
His season suffered a setback at Imola where he was fortunate to escape unscathed when his Lotus ran into the back of Lehtos stalled Benetton and was soon shattered when he was involved in a massive testing accident at Silverstone. Lamys car ended up over the barriers with Pedro suffering fractured and dislocated knees and a broken wrist, but it could have been much, much worse. Happily, he made an amazingly swift recovery, and was soon back in the paddock looking to get back into competition at the earliest opportunity. In the event he had to wait until the middle of 1995 when Minardi finally decided to dispense with the services of Pierluigi Martini, but he was quickly back in the groove, matching the performances of team-mate Luca Badoer. Sixth place at the seasons finale in Adelaide brought the softly spoken Lamy his first World Championship point, and a seat with the team in 1996. 
With the demise of Simtek, Pacific and Forti, Minardi were once again consigned to the back of the field, and Lamys main challenge came from his team-mates, Fisichella, Marques and later Lavaggi. The former in particular proved a stern test, and when the pair took each other out on the first lap at Monaco Giancarlo Minardi not unnaturally castigated his young chargers. Unfortunately Pedro was out of the GP frame for 1997 and he successfully chased a GT ride with Porsche, taking fifth at Le Mans. 
He joined Olivier Beretta to race the works Chrysler Viper in 1998, and the pair stormed to the GT2 title, scoring eight wins in their class. The ambitious Lamy, however, was keen to move up to prototypes and, after winning a place in the ill-fated works Mercedes squad for Le Mans alongside Schneider and Lagorce, the Portuguese driver sampled life in the American Le Mans Series with a BMW V12 LM in the hope of running the full season in 2000.";
84;"Martin Brundle";1;1.6.1959;"Кингс-Линн";"Норфолк (Англия)";"графство";;"Мартин Брандл";"";"";"It must have been more than a little galling for Brundle to see Ayrton Senna sweeping all before him in Grand Prix racing, for they were once very evenly matched in Formula 3. Martin may not have the innate talent of the sadly deceased World Champion but, in a truly competitive F1 car, he would surely have been a Grand Prix winner at the very least. 
Back in 1983, Brundle started the F3 season buoyed by a strong finish to his first year in the series and ready to pit himself against Senna, the latest Formula Ford/FF2000 hot-shot. Watching the Brazilian simply disappear into the distance to win no fewer than nine races would have broken the resolve of a lesser man, but in the second half of the season Martin staged a comeback. Winning six races, he fell just short in the chase for the Marlboro F3 title, but had given his career prospects a massive boost. 
Joining Tyrrell in 1984, he finished fifth in his first race, and the nimble Cosworth-powered car was later in its element at Detroit, where Martin took a brilliant second place. Then came two blows to his progress. A practice crash at Dallas left him with broken ankles, ending his season, and, to add insult to injury, Tyrrells points were later expunged due to the teams technical misdemeanours. Starting from scratch in 1985, Brundle waited patiently for the Renault turbo engine which by now was a long-overdue necessity for the team. Driving sensibly and displaying great car control, Brundle did what he could with the equipment at his disposal, showing the odd flash of naked aggression, no doubt due to the frustration of being so far off the pace. 
Reasoning that any move would be beneficial, Brundle opted to join Zakspeed in 1987 but, a gutsy fifth at Imola notwithstanding, it turned out to be a big mistake. Now four seasons into his Grand Prix career and seemingly no further forward than when he came into Formula 1, Martin took the brave decision to join Jaguar for a season of sports car racing rather than just trail round at the tail-end of the Grand Prix pack. His courage was rewarded, the Norfolk man winning the World Sports Car drivers title with victories at Jarama, Monza, Silverstone, Brands Hatch and Fuji. In tandem with this programme, he jetted back and forth across the Atlantic to compete for Jaguar in IMSA, sharing the winning car in the Daytona 24 Hours. 
A one-off drive for Williams at Spa kept Brundle in the picture, and for 1989 he joined the Brabham team as a much more confident and purposeful performer, bringing the Judd-powered car into the points on three occasions. Unfortunately the team was already suffering from financial strictures and, tiring of the uncertainty over Brabhams plans, Martin went back to Jaguar for the 1990 season, the highlight of which was, of course, the teams Le Mans victory when Brundle shared the winning car with John Nielsen and Price Cobb. Tempted by a package which included a Yamaha engine, he rejoined Brabham for 1991, but spent a generally frustrating season watching the stop-start development of a quite promising car gradually tail away. 
By the end of the year he was glad to be able to look forward to a really good drive at last. Joining his old Jaguar boss Tom Walkinshaw at Benetton, Brundle made a pretty disastrous start in the first four races, which in retrospect fatally damaged his long-term prospects with the team. From Imola onwards Martin scored points in every round bar Canada (a race which he could well have won), and it was very hard on him indeed when he was dropped in favour of Patrese. He moved to Ligier for 1993 and, after another tardy start to the season, helped bring about a welcome improvement in the teams fortunes, showing an application that had been sorely lacking there. His reward should have been the chance to carry on the good work in 1994, but in the end Martin successfully bided his time before grabbing the drive at McLaren vacated by Senna. 
Brundles second place at Monaco was the high spot in a fraught season at Woking, with the newly forged alliance with Peugeot doomed to last just 16 races. Honest, open and diligent, Martin would have loved to stay with the team for 1995, but in the end his seat went to Nigel Mansell. Brundle made a swift return to Ligier to work with Tom Walkinshaw once again, though the Mugen-Honda engine deal meant that Martin would only compete in 11 of the 17 races. Brundle shone on the teams home track of Magny Cours, hounding Coulthards Williams to the finish line to claim fourth, and he picked up a place on the podium at Spa, but could achieve little else with a car that just wasnt quick enough. 
The 1996 season saw Martin on the move once more, joining up again with Eddie Jordan (his old boss from the far-off F3 days of 1983). With Jordan needing to deliver the goods, it was to be a tough year for the once happy-go-lucky team who had by now become serious heavyweight under-achievers. After miraculously emerging unscathed from a first-corner crash in the opening Grand Prix at Melbourne, Brundle struggled to come to terms with the cars set-up. By mid-season things had improved but, crucially, he and team-mate Barrichello had already lost the confidence of the team management and both were bundled out at seasons end to make way for Fisichella and Ralf Schumacher. 
With no further Formula 1 prospects, Martin has since forged a brilliantly successful career as a TV commentator and taken on the role of adviser to David Coulthard. He kept his reflexes sharp by racing for Toyota at Le Mans for three successive years between 1997 and 1999 but, after coming so close to victory on two occasions, seems unlikely to return for a fourth time in 2000.";
85;"Andrea Montermini";7;30.5.1964;"Сассуоло";"Эмилия-Романья";"область";;"Андреа Монтермини";"";"";"When Montermini crashed his Simtek heavily during practice for the 1994 Spanish GP and was taken to hospital with relatively minor ankle and foot injuries, a number of observers thought that might be the last Grand Prix racing would see of the little Italian, rather cruelly commenting that he was not good enough to take part at this exalted level. Of course he did return, albeit only with back-of-the-grid strugglers Pacific and Forti, and succeeded in winning the respect of the Formula 1 paddock at large, with his racers appetite remaining undimmed despite overwhelming odds. 
A closer look at Andreas racing history reveals a good deal of success during the early stages of his career, which began in 1987 in Italian Formula Alfa Boxer. Fourth place in the 1988 Italian F3 standings was supplemented by second place in the Monaco F5 race the following year. 
Montermini then spent three seasons in European F3000 between 1990 and 1992: his first year, with Madgwick, was promising, the second, in a difficult-to-tame Ralt, perhaps less so. However, the Italians final season in the formula, though beset by financial problems which saw him swap teams, brought him second place in the championship with three wins. 
In 1993 Andrea caused a stir in Indy Car circles when he arrived in Detroit to drive a year-old Lola for the Euromotorsports team. Sixth place in practice was impressive, and fourth at the finish an outstanding achievement. Since the collapse of Forti in mid-1996 Montermini has pursued a career in sports cars, initially impressing with Gianpiero Morettis Ferrari in 1997. Wins in the Professional Racing Series at Lime Rock, Pikes Peak Raceway and Sebring led to a Nissan works drive at Le Mans in 1998, where, teamed with Lammers and Comas, he took sixth place, a feat which he repeated a year later at the wheel of a Courage-Nissan in company with fellow countrymen Caffi and Schiattarella. 
The diminutive Italian joined Dan Gurneys underperforming CART team for a four-race spell towards the end of 1999, scoring a couple of points on his debut in Vancouver, while no doubt hoping to find a full-time drive in this increasingly competitive category.";
86;"Giovanni Lavaggi";7;18.2.1958;"Аугуста";"Сицилия";"область";;"Джованни Лаваджи";"";"";"A former consultant engineer, Lavaggi began competing in local rallies, but then got his kicks skiing and hang-gliding until a broken leg ended this dangerous pastime. 
Returning to the track, Giovanni quickly found a niche, successfully handling a Kremer Porsche 962 sports car in 1989. But with Formula 1 his long-term aim, he cut down on his business commitments to spend a preparatory year in F3000. His 1992 season with Crypton was disappointing to say the least, with the Italian failing to qualify for eight of ten races. 
Undaunted by the collapse of the March F1 team, for whom he had hoped to drive, the personable and friendly Lavaggi had a brief tilt at Indy Car racing in 1994 before he raised enough finance to buy his four-race stint at Pacific in 1995. Giovanni was briefly back on the Grand Prix stage the following season with cash-strapped Minardi, where, to his credit, he was not that far off the pace of team-mate Pedro Lamy. 
Lavaggi found his true level in sports car racing, his victory in the 1995 Daytona 24-hour race, in which he shared a Kremer Porsche, being the undoubted highlight of his career.";
87;"Mark Blundell";1;8.4.1966;"Барнет";"Хартфордшир (Англия)";"графство";;"Марк Бланделл";"";"";"Mark Blundell is typical of a generation of British drivers who have worked so hard to get into Formula 1 - a lot of talent but not a lot of money. This former motocross rider had a quite remarkable first season in Formula Ford, winning 25 of his 70 races and receiving the 1984 Grovewood Award in recognition of this achievement. 
The next two seasons were spent in FF1600 and FF2000, before Mark plunged straight into the F3000 championship for 1987 with an elderly Lola. Cracking drives in early-season races at Spa and Vallelunga brought him points-scoring finishes and seemed to vindicate his decision to miss out on the traditional stepping-stone of Formula 3, especially when he was offered the works Lola for the 1988 F3000 season. Second place in the opening round at Jerez showed promise, but the season then slid away in a mire of development tweaks that saw the car engineered out of competitiveness. 
In some ways 1989 was a make-or-break year for Blundell in F3000. He moved to the Middlebridge team and all the ingredients for success seemed to be there, but his season was ragged and he failed to make the top ten in the final points standings. Nevertheless he must have shown something, because Nissan paired him with Julian Bailey in their rapid car to contest the endurance championship and Williams signed him as a test driver for 1990. 
It was a year well spent as Mark familiarised himself with the intricacies of a Formula 1 car, but with no prospect of racing for the team in the immediate future he understandably accepted an offer to join Brabham-Yamaha for 1991. Paired with the experienced Martin Brundle, he was certainly not overshadowed, and scored his first championship point at Spa in the Belgian GP. However, the finances of the team were already parlous and Blundell was reluctantly shown the door in favour of paying guests at seasons end. 
The 1992 season was again spent on the F1 bench, Mark acting as test driver for McLaren, but brought an unexpected highlight when, in a one-off appearance for Peugeot, he won the Le Mans 24 Hours with Derek Warwick and Yannick Dalmas. The well-funded but under-achieving Ligier team had changed hands and, despite much criticism in the French press, new owner Cyril de Rouvre hired both Blundell and Brundle to revive their fortunes in 1993. Marks superb third place in the opening race, followed by a fifth next time out in Brazil, boded well, but as the season wore on question marks were raised as the number of spins and incidents mounted, and suddenly he was facing an anxious winter, hoping to land a drive in 1994. In the event he found a berth at Tyrrell and Marks third place in Spain was a fillip for a team struggling to restore their lost credibility. Surprisingly, it was the hitherto unregarded Katayama who took the eye as the year progressed and once more Mark was seeking employment at seasons end. Luckily for him, Nigel Mansells highly touted return to F1 with McLaren ended in farce, and the no-nonsense racer stepped up from the role of test driver, impressing everyone once more with his commitment. Though not far behind team-mate Hakkinen in terms of points, Blundell was perhaps always seen as a stop-gap until the arrival of David Coulthard, and he grabbed the opportunity to continue his racing career in Indy cars at PacWest after impressing in testing sessions which included fellow aspirants Allan McNish and JJ Lehto. 
It was to be a frightening baptism for Blundell, who survived a monumental crash in only his second outing at Rio which sidelined him with a foot injury. Naturally it took some while for his confidence to return, but in 1997 success came in the form of three race wins (at Portland, Toronto and the 500-miler at Fontana). So outstanding were his performances that it seemed that Mark was a serious championship contender for 1998, but the PacWest bubble had burst, and the hapless driver ended up a lowly equal 17th in the final points standings. His 1999 season was no better, interrupted as it was by a neck injury incurred in a testing accident which caused him to miss eight races. 
However, PacWest and sponsor Motorola still have great faith in their man, handing him a new two-year contract. Mercedes are focusing their efforts on Bruce McCaws outfit in 2000, so Mark can look forward to an upturn in his fortunes and is confident of a return to the winners circle.";
88;"Aguri Suzuki";9;8.9.1960;"Токио";"Токио (Канто)";"префектура";;"Агури Судзуки";"";"";"To date Suzuki is Japans most successful Grand Prix contender, and the only one to stand on the podium, courtesy of his excellent third place in the 1990 Japanese GP. His father was the founder of the Japanese karting association, and the young Suzuki naturally became involved in the sport, winning the title in 1981. He then moved into F3 and finished second in the 1983 championship, which brought an offer to race for Nissan in sports and touring cars, Aguri taking the 1986 Group A championship. 
Single-seaters were still his first priority, and in 1987 Suzuki went into the All-Japan F3000 series, finishing runner-up, before finishing the job the following year by taking the title. His eyes were now on Grand Prix racing and he briefly came to Europe to race the Footwork-backed March in the F3000 series, before being given a race in the Japanese GP with the Larrousse team in place of the indisposed Dalmas. Having previously been associated with Yamaha, Aguri joined the Zakspeed team which was running the Japanese manufacturers engines for 1989, but Suzuki drew a complete blank, failing even to pre-qualify the hopeless device at every one of the 16 Grands Prix. 
This could have sunk many a drivers career, but luckily he was able to find a drive with Larrousse in 1990, when he became a points-scorer on three occasions, including his splendid drive at Suzuka, which cemented his future. Unfortunately the precarious financial position at Larrousse, and consequent lack of testing and development, blunted his progress the following year, and for 1992 Aguri joined the Footwork team, which was itself regrouping, but armed with the Mugen Honda V10. Suzukis season was disappointing, his form not helped by the problems he had fitting into the cockpit, and he was completely overshadowed by team-mate Michele Alboreto. For 1993, he remained with the team, paired with Derek Warwick, but once again finishes in the points eluded him. The year was punctuated by a Worryingly high number of spins and collisions, and apart from sixth place on the grid at Spa, which seemed to suit the Footworks active suspension system, there was precious little to cheer the Japanese driver, who lost his drive when the restructured Arrows team under Jack Oliver were no longer in receipt of finance from the Far East. 
Aguri then returned home to race for Nissan, perhaps thinking his F1 career was behind him, but, with Eddie Irvine suspended, he was brought into the Jordan team at the Pacific GP. Suzuki was uneasy about this because of his lack of preparation and fitness and was to be proved right when he spun out. It did not hurt his long-term plans, however, and, with Mugen Hondas backing, he signed to race for Ligier in 1995 in a season shared with Martin Brundle. Sixth place at Hockenheim apart, the Japanese driver looked less than convincing when compared with his team-mates. Aguri had already decided to retire from Formula 1 after the Japanese GP, but a practice accident at Suzuka left him with cracked ribs and unable to take any further part in proceedings. 
For 1996 Suzuki signed a contract with Nissan to return to the All-Japan GT championship to race their revised Skyline and he was a member of the crew of the TWR-run Nissan R390 which finished third at Le Mans in 1998. He has subsequently formed his own Formula Nippon team and continues to race with a Toyota Supra in the All-Japan GT series.";

You know the sort of thing: residence, hobbies, favourite music, favourite singers, favourite food, etc. How about Monte Carlo, shopping, jazz and rock, Eric Clapton and Globe fish! Well, its a hell of a lot more interesting than Takis racing exploits, which date back to 1985 and the Fuji Freshman championship. He came to England to compete in FF1600 in 1987 before returning home to tackle Japanese F3 through until 1993, the sum total of his achievements being a few fourth places. A move into Japanese F3000 with a top team, Super Nova, still brought little by way of results, but that didnt prevent him gaining a superlicence to race for Simtek in the Japanese GP. Result - spun into pit wall along the straight. 
Far from that being the end of Inoues Grand Prix curriculum vitae, he found the necessary to buy a seat at Footwork for the whole 1995 season; Jack Oliver must have needed the dosh. His learning curve has been steep, but his performance very flat, Oliver is quoted as saying in Autocourse. Indeed it was two bizarre incidents that he was involved in (happily without serious injury) which left the most impression, the first when his Footwork was overturned by the course car in Monaco while being towed back to the pits, the second in Hungary when he was knocked flying by a rescue vehicle sent to attend after his car had broken down.

90;"Roberto Moreno";2;11.2.1959;"Рио-де-Жанейро";"Рио-де-Жанейро";"штат";"Roberto Pupo Moreno";"Роберто Морено";"";"";"I doubt if there is a driver featured in this book with more resilience than Roberto Moreno. Over the past two decades plenty of talented drivers have, at best, seen their careers end up in racing cul-de-sacs or found themselves with no drives at all. The Brazilian has faced both these hurdles with seemingly endless regularity, but has still managed, by a combination of unquenchable optimism, huge application and no little ability, to remain much in demand. 
A childhood friend and karting companion of Nelson Piquet, Roberto followed the future World Champion to Europe in 1979; he soon made a big impact in a Royale, and then in 1980 won 15 races and the British FF1600 championship in a Van Diemen, A testing contract with Lotus gave Moreno the lifeline to sustain a Formula 3 career, while a victory in the Australian GP with a Ralt (beating Piquet and Jones) at the end of 1981 raised his profile greatly. He started 1982 winning in Formula Atlantic in the USA before having a disastrous outing for Lotus at Zandvoort, where he failed to qualify, which handicapped his career for a number of years. In 1984 he finished second to team-mate Thackwell in the Formula 2 championship, but a chance of a Formula 1 return with Toleman foundered when the team failed to tie up a tyre deal. This led Roberto to try his hand at Indy Car racing with Rick Galles, and while results were disappointing the little Brazilian certainly impressed. 
Returning to Europe in 1987, Moreno was back with Ralt in F3000, but his luck was out. Leading round after round, his car always seemed to hit trouble and he only managed to win one race, at Enna. Fortune did smile with a return to Grands Prix with the little AGS team which yielded a point in the Australian GP, but with no chance of racing with them in 1988 due to a lack of funds Moreno was forced to stay in F3000, and showed his talent by clinching the championship with a virtually unsponsored Reynard, winning four rounds. 
Buoyed by a testing contract with Ferrari, Roberto took up a drive with Coloni, then joined EuroBrun, only for the team to fold. Dramatically, after a run of non-qualifications, he was then given the Benetton seat in place of the injured Nannini, and a sensational debut in Japan saw him finish second to team-mate Piquet and gain a well-earned contract for 1991. His big season was something of an anti-climax, however, and when Michael Schumacher was snatched from Jordan, Roberto found himself turfed out of the team, ironically after his best race of the year at Spa. After seeing out the season with Jordan and Minardi, Moreno was back at square one in 1992, with the hapless Andrea Moda outfit, though he did brilliantly to qualify the car at Monaco. When the team were finally thrown out of the championship Roberto was left with no option but to find a ride in Italian touring cars, but in 1993 he was enjoying his racing again with an Alfa in the French Supertourisme championship. 
It was quite a surprise when it was announced that Roberto would partner Pedro Diniz in the new Forti Corse F1 team in 1995, but the all-Brazilian driver pairing were forced to spend most of their races looking in their mirrors as the leaders lapped them with monotonous regularity. In 1996, after a ten-year absence, Roberto returned to Indy Car racing with the underfinanced Payton-Coyne Racing. Predictably his professionalism brought its reward with a superb third place in the US 500 at Michigan, the teams best-ever finish. Initially without a ride for 1997, Roberto was soon in action as a replacement for the injured Christian Fittipaldi at Newman-Haas. The fact that he outqualified team-mate Michael Andretti three times in six races raised a few eyebrows, but no one else, it seemed, shared the Brazilians innate self-confidence. 
The following season began with two races for Project Indy before Moreno quit, and it seemed that his only future lay in the Indy Racing League. Indeed he started 1999 in that category with a sixth place at Phoenix before another call into CART action as a substitute for Mark Blundell at PacWest. Roberto immediately established a great rapport with the team and helped to refocus their efforts before taking on an even more rewarding stand-in role at Newman-Haas. Once again Moreno stepped in for the unfortunate Fittipaldi and drove splendidly, taking a career-best second place at Laguna Seca. It seems Robertos efforts have been recognised at last, as Supersub finally gets a full-time ride with Patrick Racing for 2000.";
91;"Karl Wendlinger";22;20.12.1968;"Куфштайн";"Тироль";"земля";;"Карл Вендлингер";"";"";"Racing was in Wendlingers blood, for both his father and grandfather had competed in the past and naturally Karl  followed suit. After some karting experience the Austrian was helped greatly by Gerhard Berger (an old family friend) to get started in FF1600 in 1987. 
Assisted by the former Grand Prix driver Dr Helmut Marko, he came to the fore in the 1989 German F3 championship with some excellent drives in a Ralt and took the title, edging out Schumacher and Frentzen after the closest fought of battles. 
This trio of young talent was then selected by Mercedes-Benz to be groomed in their Group C programme as possible candidates for a future Formula 1 return. Paired with Jochen Mass, the best possible tutor, the young Austrian learned quickly and helped the company achieve its goal of winning the teams championship with a win at Spa and second places at Suzuka and Monza. However, the necessity of having top-class equipment at his disposal was brought home when he endured a rather lacklustre time in Formula 3000 that year with a Helmut Marko-run Lola, taking only two championship points. The 1991 season saw the two star pupils Wendlinger and Schumacher paired together in the same Mercedes, and they performed splendidly in the somewhat less than previously dominant silver cars. A win at Autopolis was the high point of the season, and Karl was found a place in the Leyton House team for the final two races of the year. All eyes were really opened in South Africa at the beginning of 1992, when he qualified the largely unregarded car in seventh place on the grid. A brilliant fourth place in Canada gave some indication of the drivers potential, but the season was largely inconclusive due to reliability problems with the llmor V10. It had been a useful preparatory year for Karl, and for 1993 he moved to the new Sauber team as Mercedes had foreseen. In its first season the Swiss entrant made excellent progress and Wendlinger scored points on four occasions, though he was unfortunately involved in a number of on-track incidents which blotted his copybook somewhat. 
The 1994 season saw Karl partnered by his ex-Mercedes Group C team-mate Heinz-Harald Frentzen, and it was immediately apparent that the newcomer meant business. Everything started satisfactorily for Wendlinger with points-scoring finishes in Brazil and at Imola, but then he was involved in a relatively low-speed crash during practice for the Monaco GP, the impact resulting in a brain contusion and swelling. He was immediately hospitalised and kept in a stable condition by means of a medically induced coma for almost three weeks, but thankfully he was soon on the road to recovery, although it was not until near the end of the season that he returned to the cockpit. Unfortunately after testing in Barcelona he was not well enough to race and he had to wait until the beginning of 1995 to resume his career. Somehow the old spark was missing, and Wendlinger visibly struggled to come to terms with the sheer speed of Frentzen. Eventually Sauber took the tough decision to rest him from the team in favour of Jean-Christophe Boullion, and it was only at seasons end, when the Frenchman had seen his star wane in the wake of some poor performances, that Karl was brought back for a final chance to show he could still do the business. Sadly it seems that when he withdrew from the Australian GP suffering the effects of a practice crash, his fate was sealed. 
Instead of looking back on a lost career, Karl started to build a new one. A two-year contract with Audi saw Wendlinger compete in both the German and Italian Super Touring series, before he was invited to join the ORECA team for 1998 to drive their Chrysler Viper. A win in the GT2 class with Justin Bell at the A1 -Ring brought his first victory of any kind since his Group C Mercedes days in 1991 and, with the Austrian teaming up with Olivier Beretta for 1999, the Viper pair stormed to the newly formed Sports Racing World Cup, winning six of the nine rounds. Wendlinger also found time to successfully compete in the American Le Mans Series with the same car.";

Brilliantly successful in Formula Ford, winning the major British 1600 title in 1985 and the 2000 crown the following year after a torrid battle with Mark Blundell, Bertrand graduated to the British F3 championship with West Surrey Racing for 1987 and emerged as runner-up after another no-holds-barred battle, this time with Johnny Herbert. 
A solid 1988 season in F3000 lacked only a win and he finished fifth overall, quickly tying up a deal to race for the newly formed Onyx Grand Prix team in 1989. It was not a happy season for Gachot who, having been overshadowed by the experienced Johansson, found himself replaced by J J Lehto. Taking his sponsorship money to Rial for a couple more unproductive outings, Gachot then plunged into a disastrous 1990 season with the Coloni-Subaru. Then came the big break with Eddie Jordans fledgling F1 team, whose new Gary Anderson-designed car was a revelation. Suddenly Gachot was really racing and showing his undoubted talent - until his shock incarceration. His drive with Jordan was lost but, undaunted, he bounced back with the struggling Larrousse team. Bertrands F1 career was on hold in 1993 - although he made a good Indy Car debut at Toronto - while he finalised plans to lead Pacifics Grand Prix challenge in 1994. 
Bertrand had worked ceaselessly to help find sponsorship for the team and it must have been doubly hard for him to realise that the PR01 was a substandard car which had no prospects of improvement. Although the sparser grids in 1995 guaranteed that Pacific would at least be starting races, their second Grand Prix challenger proved no great step forward from the first, despite being a totally new design. As the teams financial situation worsened Gachot stood down to allow pay drivers Lavaggi and Deletraz to provide a cash lifeline, but he did return for the last three races to see out the season. 
Given Pacifics previous track record of excellence in other formulae, there was plenty of sympathy for their hapless plight, but there is no room for sentiment in F1 and the team followed Simtek into liquidation. For Keith Wiggins and Bertrand Gachot, a dream was over.";

Mimmo began racing in Italian Formula 4 back in 1985. He won that championship the following term and graduated to Italian Formula 3, where he was to spend the next three years. By 1991 he was a leading runner along with the likes of Badoer and Jacques Villeneuve, but threw away his chance of becoming the champion in the final round at Vallelunga when he pushed his title rival Giambattista Busi off the circuit and was black-flagged. 
Schiattarella then spent part of the next year in the Sud-Am championship before making an end-of-year appearance in the Macau F3 race, where he finished fifth. 
A couple of outings in the Project Indy Lola tested the Indy Car waters, but the chance to drive for Simtek at the end of the 1994 season whetted his appetite for more in 1995. Apparently his contract was for the first half of the year only, with Hideki Noda laying down his wedge of cash for the balance of the season. In the event Mimmo1 failed to get past round five at Monaco as Simtek, despite possessing a very promising car, were in such financial difficulties that they could no longer carry on. 
Subsequently Schiattarella has, in the main, concentrated on sports car racing. In 1996 he won the Vallelunga 6 Hours in a Ferrari F40 against moderate opposition, and he shared a Lotus GT1 with Luca Badoer on a couple of occasions the following year. The 1998 season saw the briefest of returns to single-seaters in CART with Project Indy after Moreno quit the team. A race at Long Beach was to be their final outing of the year as a lack of funding forced them out. 
Mimmo found a competitive ride at last in 1999 driving Team Rafanellis Riley & Scott MkII sports car in the American Le Mans Series. Teamed with Eric van de Poele, he won the opening round at Road Atlanta and placed well elsewhere.

He then became a well-respected part of the Grand Prix community, albeit with only a tantalising glimpse of ultimate success. 
The nephew of Italian seventies racer Giancarlo Martini, Pierluigi spent a couple of years hidden in Italian F3 driving the ubiquitous Dallara before emerging as something of a surprise European F3 champion in 1983. At the wheel of a Pavesi Ralt, he put together a late-season run to snatch the title at the very last from under the nose of John Nielsen, but a second place on his Formula 2 debut in a Minardi that season may have given him ideas above his station. After he had tested a Brabham but failed to land a drive, 1984 saw a hapless attempt to qualify a works Toleman at Monza and his lack of experience was merely amplified during the 1985 season. The task of leading the singleton Minardi challenge was beyond him and he dropped back to F3000 for the 1986 season with the Pavesi team. It proved to be a good decision for, freed from the pressure of Formula 1, he soon found his feet to put in a determined bid for the championship, winning rounds at Imola, Mugello and Birmingham. Any hopes of a title win were dashed when he was disqualified in the final round at Jarama after some illegal tinkering with the car between the two parts of the interrupted race. The team lost their way the following year, constantly switching Ralt chassis, and Pierluigi was largely wasting his time. A move to the FIRST team in 1988 bounced him back to the front despite being hampered by a difficult March chassis, and a victory at Enna kept his interest in the series alive even though he had made a surprise return to Grand Prix racing with Minardi. 
Scoring their first-ever championship point on his comeback in Detroit, the Italian soon found himself the spearhead of the little Faenza outfits upward progress. In 1989 he hauled the team from the brink of the pre-qualification abyss to a brief but brilliant moment at Estoril when for one glorious lap a Minardi led a Grand Prix. At the last race of the year in Adelaide, he qualified third on the grid but had to settle for a distant sixth place on unsuitable Pirelli race tyres, and the following season was to prove relatively uneventful while Minardi waited with eager anticipation for the Ferrari power which they hoped would provide the leg-up required to place them among the front-runners. 
Sadly for Martini, the partnership was hardly a distinguished one, and at the end of the year he moved to Scuderia Italia along with the V12 engines. It was akin to being transferred from one First Division football team to another when the player was eyeing a move to the Premiership. Enduring a year of endless frustrations, Martini found himself without a drive when the team concluded a deal to race Lolas in 1993. He wasnt to know how lucky he was to miss out on that debacle. He bided his time before keeping his Grand Prix career alive with a mid-season return to the homely confines of Minardi. After all this time, it was hard to see him breaking out of the ranks of the also-ran teams - no matter how much he may previously have deserved the chance. So it was to prove, Pierluigi running for the most part in midfield anonymity until the middle of the 1995 season when his drive was taken by the then up-and-coming Portuguese driver Pedro Lamy. 
Although his Grand Prix sojourn had come to an end, Martini accepted the chance to race Scuderia Italias Porsche 911 GT1 in 1997 and took a win in Joests Porsche WSC95 at Donington with Stefan Johansson. The pinnacle of the little Italians career finally arrived in 1999 when he partnered Yannick Dalmas and Jo Winkelhock to victory at Le Mans driving a works BMW V12 LMR. Having turned down the chance to race sports cars in the USA, Pierluigi is currently chasing a suitable touring car drive for 2000.";

The 1990 French FF1600 champion was soon impressing all in the French F3 championship with his style and speed. Fourth place in the 1992 series was a disappointment and reflected the major chink in his armour, inconsistency. Nevertheless he moved up to F3000 with Apomatox and endured a character-building year which yielded two second-place finishes. The shy and hitherto uncommunicative Frenchman really came of age in 1994 when a switch to DAMS saw him mount a late-season charge, Bouillon winning the last three races to snatch the title at the final round. 
Given a testing contract with Williams for 1995, he was soon setting some impressive times and jumped at the chance to race for Sauber in place of the disappointing Wendlinger. In view of his inexperience, Boullion did well to record two points-scoring finishes. However, on the debit side, perhaps he was pushing too hard, for there were too many spins. 
His testing expertise was never in doubt, as he was capable of matching the times of Damon Hill. But questions still lingered over his qualities as a racer. Apart from the Renault Spyder series in 1997, Boullion had little opportunity to compete, accepting the task of shaking down the BAR teams first Grand Prix challenger in 1998 before returning to the Williams fold in 1999 to race their Laguna in the BTCC series.

He finished his first year a very creditable sixth in the standings, but his 1986 season was less startling as the newly formed Coloni team struggled to find its feet, though he did score third places at Enna and the Osterreichring. 
Joining Lamberto Leonis FIRST racing ream for 1987, Gabriele was once again a nearly-man in terms of ultimate success, but he made his Formula 1 debut for Osella at Imola, and then rejoined Enzo Coloni for a testing first Grand Prix season in 1988. 
With poor Philippe Streiff gravely injured in a Brazilian testing accident, Tarquini came into the AGS line-up for the 1989 San Marino GP, soon gaining a priceless point for the little team in Mexico. Over the next three seasons, the ever-cheerful Italian plugged away against insurmountable odds as the debt-ridden team headed towards extinction, but before the end came he had been allowed to sign for Fondmetal (formerly Osella). With Ford HB engines at his disposal for 1992, Tarquini had easily his best opportunity to shine but the team was hampered by a lack of adequate funding - the Italian was under strict instructions to conserve the car at all costs -and any promise it had possessed soon evaporated, resulting in the outfits withdrawal before the season was out. 
Tarquini then joined the horde of famous names in the Italian touring car championship in 1993, taking third place in the series with a works Alfa Romeo. He was chosen to spearhead the Italian manufacturers move into the BTCC series in 1994 and enjoyed a highly successful season, winning eight of the 21 rounds to take the championship crown. Gabriele also gained well-earned plaudits from all for his off-track demeanour and was a credit to the series and his sport. 
It was going to be tough to follow this success in 1995, and so it proved as Alfa lost their advantage. Gabriele was initially racing in Italy, but the companys sudden decision to withdraw from their domestic championship saw him back in Britain for the balance of the year. The sudden transition from being the dominant force to midfield strugglers was quite a shock but Tarquini always gave of his best. 
Partly due to his links with Fondmetal, he had been an occasional test driver for Tyrrell, and was drafted in to deputise for the indisposed Katayama at the Nurburgring, though his one-off F1 return was not a particularly distinguished one. 
In 1996 Gabriele stepped up to the high-profile International Touring Car series as a works driver alongside the experienced Larini and Nannini in the Alfa 155 V6 Tl and scored a big win at Silverstone, but endured a thin time otherwise. 
So it was back to the Super Touring category in 1997, the Italian switching his allegiance to Honda. Although Gabrieles three seasons driving the Accord in both the BTCC and the German Super Touring series have produced no more than the occasional win, the driver himself is still regarded as one of the classs most accomplished performers.";

Thus began the worrying trend of pilots of modest pedigree making up the numbers. Certainly Deletrazs qualifications to compete at the highest level looked questionable, especially given his lack of recent top-flight competition, when he turned up to drive for Larrousse in Adelaide in 1994. 
The wealthy Swiss had made a promising start to his career in French FF1600 back in 1985, but achieved littie in two seasons of Formula 3 thereafter. His F5000 credentials were bolstered by a couple of third places for the GDBA team in 1988, but otherwise his record was unimpressive. Given Pacifics desperate financial state at the end of 1995, they could be excused for taking any lifeline thrown when he bought his rides, but the deal merely delayed the teams inevitable demise.

He will never be able to match the feats achieved by the legendary Sir Jack, but that should not reflect badly on David, who has thus far managed a worthy career without the aid of the massive finances needed for ultimate success. 
A quick learner, David soon outgrew the Australian and New Zealand single-seater scene and headed first to the States to race in Formula Atlantic, then to England in 1988, initially to contest the Formula Vauxhall Lotus championship. This proved a backward step but a switch to Class B of the Formula 3 series was an instant success, Brabham winning five times from just nine starts. Moving up to Class A with the Jewson-backed Bowman Rait the following season, he had a season-long battle for the F3 championship with Allan McNish in 1989, which was only resolved in Davids favour on appeal the following February. With a win in the prestigious Macau F3 race, Brabham seemed set for a year in F3000 with Middlebridge Racing, but this was suddenly to become a Grand Prix chance when they acquired the Brabham team and Gregor Foitek quit his seat after just two races of the 1990 season. He applied himself sensibly and did as much as a novice could in an uncompetitive car, but was not retained at seasons end. Turning to sports cars, David drove for TWR Jaguar in 1991 (winning at the Nurburgring with Warwick) and Toyota in 1992 while waiting for the opportunity to return to Grand Prix racing, which finally presented itself with the ambitious but unproven Simtek team hiring him to lead their assault in 1994. It was a character-building year in which David was the teams mainstay. Following the tragic death of Roland Ratzenberger, he was partnered by no fewer than four other drivers and his determination and dedication in the face of adversity (which included a huge testing accident at Silverstone) were exemplary. 
With Nick Wirths fledgling outfit facing an uncertain future at the beginning of 1995, David amicably took his leave for the chance of a paid seat with BMW in the ever-growing BTCC. The aerodynamic regulations and rear-wheel drive configuration of the 318i left him at a great disadvantage, but typically Brabham got on with the job and was certainly not overshadowed by his much more experienced team-mate, multiple saloon champion Johnny Cecotto. 
David understandably grabbed the chance to contest the 1996 All-Japan GT championship in a McLaren F1 GTR and had the satisfaction of snatching the title from main rival Ralf Schumacher. His success in this form of racing brought the opportunity to race a Panoz in 1997, and he has since been a standard-bearer for the marque, putting in a succession of excellent performances over the past three seasons which have seen him become a regular contender for honours. His disappointment must then have been immense when he found himself pipped at the last in the 1999 American Le Mans series by a team which failed to register a single win, but benefited from the idiosyncratic points scoring system. A true gentleman, however, and one of motor racings most sporting competitors, David was the first to congratulate the victors.";
101;"Ayrton Senna";2;21.3.1960;"Сан-Паулу";"Сан-Паулу";"штат";"Ayrton Senna da Silva";"Айртон Сенна";"01.05.1994";"Болонья, Италия";"The wonder of the age, Sennas colossal talent bestrode Grand Prix racing for a decade. He had virtually made it his own personal fiefdom (in the widest sense) with a frightening intensity and commitment that could be viewed as bordering on arrogance. Yet Sennas creed was simplicity itself; his innate talent, just like that of a great musician, was to be continually developed day by day, year after year. To achieve this goal everything else must match his expectations: the machine and organisation at his disposal had to perform to his exacting standards or they served no useful purpose. Toleman, Lotus and then McLaren were blessed by his gifts, but immediately discarded when no longer of use. At the beginning of 1994 Ayrton, having finally landed the Williams-Renault drive he had long coveted, stood poised on the edge of another period of success. Then, with the new partnership having barely begun, came that blackest of weekends at Imola... 
From a well-to-do Brazilian family, Ayrton was racing karts from a very early age and in fact had amassed eight seasons experience before coming to Britain to make his Formula Ford debut in 1981. Twelve wins ensured the FF1600 title was won, and the Brazilian returned the following year to continue his climb to fame and fortune in the FF2000 series. A tally of 21 wins from 27 starts tells its own story. In 1983 Ayrton joined the West Surrey Racing F3 team and became embroiled in a fabulous tussle for the Marlboro championship with Martin Brundle. In the end Sennas early-season run of wins kept him in front when the title was decided, and after testing for both Williams and McLaren he agreed to drive for Toleman in Formula 1 in 1984. 
The phenomenal talent was soon in evidence, with his drive in the wet at Monaco outstanding. Senna was poised to challenge Prost for the lead when the race was controversially stopped, but he had made his mark on an event he was to win for a staggering sixth time in 1993. When it became clear that Toleman were not able to provide Ayrton with the means to win, the Brazilian engineered his way out of his contract and joined Lotus. Almost immediately his first Grand Prix victory arrived, his skills in the wet at Estoril provoking memories of the great Jacky Ickx. Over the next three seasons Senna proved to be the fastest man around, certainly in qualifying, where he amassed 16 pole positions, but he scored only six wins, due in part to the fragility of the Lotus. It was crystal clear to Senna that to win the championship he needed a Honda engine, but definitely not a Lotus, and for 1988 he joined the McLaren team to partner Alain Prost. 
Senna was supremely confident of his ability to outdrive the Frenchman, and was as good as his word. In a season which saw McLaren take victory in all bar one of the 16 races, Ayrton emerged triumphant in a manner more convincing than the eight-wins-to-seven margin suggests. Relationships between the two superstars were never more than cordial at best, and they broke down completely in 1989 as both drivers waged war within the confines of the team. This time the championship battle ended in Prosts favour after the Brazilian was deftly taken out by the Frenchman at the Suzuka chicane. By this time, of course, Prost had nothing to lose, having already decided to take his leave of McLaren, though he and Senna were to be embroiled in further controversy the following season. With Prost needing points at Suzuka to maintain Ferraris challenge, Ayrton seemed to take his revenge, driving into the back of Prosts car at the first corner. It was an unworthy way for the title to be decided, wiping away the memory of some great performances earlier in the season. 
In many ways 1991 was Sennas finest championship triumph. The new V12 Honda was not initially markedly superior to its lighter predecessor, despite the impression given by Ayrtons four straight wins from the start of the season. In fact these had been extremely hard-won triumphs that had demanded every ounce of the Brazilians skill and guile. The following season found Senna in the unusual position of underdog, Williams and Renault finally having found the edge and the ability to sustain it. Ayrton predictably gave his all, winning at Monaco, Hungary and Monza, but perceived shortcomings at McLaren were already irking him and his frustration was probably not helped by his inability to muscle into a Williams drive alongside Prost in 1993. 
During the winter months McLaren were having to come to terms with the loss of Honda power and hoping that the replacement Ford engine would be sufficiently promising to tempt the unhappy Brazilian to continue. In the event Senna deigned to drive - initially on a race-by-race basis for a reported fee of $1 million per race. Luckily for us lesser beings, he served up a number of superlative performances which can seldom have been bettered at any time in the history of motor racing. Brazil, Donington and Adelaide showed us all why he truly was one the sports all-time greats. 
When it was announced that Senna would be joining the all-conquering Williams-Renault team for 1994, it was difficult to see how anybody was going to beat him, Mansell and Prost having taken the previous two titles with comparative ease. Things did not start well for the Brazilian, with the latest FW16 car proving troublesome to sort, although Ayrton somehow managed to assert his authority in practice, exploring the outer edges of the cars performance to take pole position. 
But in the first two races he struggled to match Schumachers Benetton, and in the third at Imola his lead in the early stages of the restarted race was looking extremely tenuous. Then came disaster. Possibly the steering column on the Williams sheared or perhaps the car became unsettled on the bumpy track surface, but the Brazilian appeared helpless as it speared into the concrete wall at the Tamburello corner. As fate would have it, part of the suspension came back and struck poor Senna, who then stood no chance of survival, being officially pronounced dead in a Bologna hospital later that afternoon. 
The aftermath of Sennas death caused shock waves to ripple through the sport. Additional safety measures, some sound and others less so, were introduced as Grand Prix racing tried to come to terms with the loss of its premier talent. For his legion of fans, he was irreplaceable and things would never be the same again. For the sport at large that awful day ushered in a new era but, although time would heal the wounds, the scars would always remain.";

Fifth place in the 1984 championship formed the platform for a successful title bid the following season. 
He had little money but decided to tackle the French F3 series. Running his own Martini-Alfa, Eric finished a creditable fifth, and armed with a Ralt for 1987 ran old rival Alesi and his mighty ORECA team very close as the pair dominated proceedings. 
The backing of Winfield and Elf facilitated the step up into F3000 and after a false start with a works Ralt Bernard switched to Bromley Motorsport to kick-start his season. A fine second place in the final round at Dijon led to a place in the DAMS Lola team for 1989. He won at Jerez, but was out of luck elsewhere and, compounding this with some unforced errors, could only finish a disappointed third in the championship. The year had its compensations, though, a couple of drives for Larrousse in mid-season paving the way for a full-time ride in 1990, with a magnificent fourth place in the British Grand Prix the highlight of his first full season. The Larrousse team lost the use of Lamborghini engines in 1991, putting Eric into the also-ran category, and his season ended disastrously when he sustained a broken leg in a practice crash at the Japanese GP. 
With the injury proving slow to heal, Bernard was sidelined for the following season, but he was not forgotten by his long-time sponsors Elf and became the Ligier teams test driver in 1993. The oil giant then placed their faith in him for 1994, and Ligier gave him a contract for the season alongside newcomer Olivier Panis. Once the Briatore/Walkinshaw axis took control, however, the student remained in situ while the tutor, despite his third-place finish in the crash-decimated German GP, was dumped after the Portuguese race and replaced by Johnny Herbert. As some recompense it was arranged for him to take the Englishmans place at Team Lotus for the European GP at Jerez but after he finished in 18th place, three laps behind, his departure from the Grand Prix stage was barely noticed. 
Eric has since followed many other erstwhile unemployed Grand Prix drivers into the world of sports car racing. After contesting the Global GT series in a Ferrari, he moved to DAMS to help develop their front-engined Panoz-Ford. The 1997 season brought little but a spate of retirements, but the following term he began an excellent partnership with David Brabham as the car became a contender for honours. 
Outright victories finally came in 1999, the Frenchman sharing wins at Portland, Road Atlanta, Donington, the Nurburgring and Kyalami with Brabham, Wallace and Gounon. When DAMS were chosen to run Cadillacs sports challenger in 2000, the team lost little time in ensuring that they had Bernards signature on a three-year contract.";

Sadly, his Grand Prix career was spent driving mediocre machinery, and he was unable to impress sufficiently to attract an offer from a front-line team and decided to pursue a career in CART. 
With a single season in South American F3 behind him, he came to Britain to race in the 1990 F3 championship. Taking the number two seat to Hakkinen in the crack West Surrey Racing team, Fittipaldi finished fourth in the final standings with just one win at Donington. Moving up to F3000 for 1991 with Pacific Racing, young Christian was certainly fortunate to be in a Reynard chassis, but he held to his conviction that consistency would count and, when he had to, could show the pack a clean pair of heels, as he proved at Jerez and Nogaro. The championship was his, and he thus became the third Grand Prix driver to emerge from this remarkable family. 
His first season with Minardi was interrupted when a practice crash at Magny Cours inflicted back injuries that put him out for a spell, but after a shaky return he bounced back in Japan to score his first championship point. Continuing with the underfinanced Minardi team in 1993, Fittipaldi started well but, with the car less and less competitive as the season progressed, the young Brazilian was stood down for the final two races to make room for the well-financed Gounon. Meanwhile Christian, his sponsors and advisers were busy trying to arrange a move to a bigger team for 1994. He moved a further rung up the Grand Prix ladder with Footwork, but was disappointed not to have made it into a better-funded team with more chance of success. The season started brightly and Christian was superb at Monaco with the neat Ford HB-engined car, qualifying sixth and running in fourth place, but things went downhill when the team became bogged down trying to implement the mid-season rule changes without the necessary resources. 
Frustrated by his lack of progress and impatient for success, Fittipaldi abandoned his Formula 1 career to join the Indy Car circuit in 1995. 
His season with Derrick Walker was naturally a learning one, and the high point was undoubtedly lasting the distance to claim second place in the Indianapolis 500. For 1996 Christian obtained a seat alongside Michael Andretti at Newman-Haas, and at last he had the opportunity to shine, looking particularly impressive in the wet at Detroit and Portland. His prospects were bright for 1997, but only two races into the season Christian suffered a badly broken leg in an accident at Surfers Paradise and did extremely well upon his return to pick up his previous pace. 
If Fittipaldi, who fitted comfortably into the Newman-Haas camp, thought a breakthrough was imminent he was to be disappointed in 1998, when minor problems often blunted the teams challenge. Christian has shown in the past that patience is a virtue and the 1999 season saw a much more complete driver. Not only did he win a CART race (at the 71st attempt, at Road America), but he looked a possible PPG Cup champion, having finished among the top ten in each of the first seven races. Unfortunately he suffered a nasty accident in testing and was forced to sit on the sidelines for five races, which scuppered his chances. 
Now just as at home on the oval tracks as on road courses, Christian, not yet thirty years of age, has the ammunition to go gunning for glory in the new millennium.";

Backed by Paolo Pavanello, he was runner-up in the 1979 Italian F3 championship and became the 1980 European F3 champion after a season-long battle with Thierry Boutsen. This led to a drive for the Minardi F2 team in 1981, which yielded an end-of-season win at Misano. With the financial backing of Count Zanon Michele had already leap-frogged this career stepping-stone by gaining a place in the Tyrrell team after an impressive Grand Prix debut at Imola which saw the curly-haired Italian smartly placed under a three-year contract. 
The next two seasons were illuminated by wins at Las Vegas and Detroit but the naturally aspirated Tyrrells were increasingly uncompetitive against the turbo onslaught and it was no great surprise when Alboreto took up the offer of a Ferrari drive for 1984. After a promising start and a victory at Zolder in the Belgian GP, the season disintegrated amid a plague of engine failures, but a strong finish to the year boded well for 1985, which was to be the high-water mark of his career. For much of the season he held off the challenge of Alain Prosts McLaren, but the team lost momentum and Michele saw his title chance blighted by mechanical failure. Although three more years were spent at Maranello, somehow things were never the same. The arrival of Gerhard Berger in 1987 pushed the Italian to the margins and he opted out of the political turmoil that was Ferrari to return to Tyrrell for 1989. 
It was to be a brief reunion, with a splendid third in Mexico in the new Tyrrell 018 the highlight, before Michele split with the team after a sponsorship clash. Thereafter his career began a swift decline in a succession of uncompetitive cars which included the disastrously overweight Porsche-engined Footwork. An Indian summer in 1992 with some revitalised performances in the Footwork-Mugen restored his credibility, but the nadir of his Formula 1 career came with a move to the Lola Scuderia Italia team. The wretched Lola-Ferrari could well have brought Alboretos tenure in Grand Prix racing to an end, but he found himself a berth with the restructured Minardi team in 1994. A single point at Monaco was garnered from a year which saw the team struggling to meet the technical changes demanded in the wake of the Senna tragedy. Increasingly disenchanted with his lot, especially after a fine levied in the wake of the German Grand Prix first-lap crash, Alboreto finally bowed out of F1 at seasons end. 
With the enticing prospect of racing the Schubel-entered Alfa Romeo T155 in the high-profile DTM and ITC championships for 1995, Michele was looking forward to some competitive racing at last. Sadly, he rarely figured among the leading runners, finishing an anonymous year with just 22nd place in the DTM to show for his efforts. 
Meanwhile selective appearances with the Dick Simon Scandia Ferrari 333SP sports car, which included a second place at Sebring in 1996, paved the way for Alboreto to race in the newly formed IRL single-seater oval series. Michele was one of a handful of name drivers contesting the 1996 championship, and he scored three top-six finishes in his five starts, though a chance of victory in the Indianapolis 500 ended with a gearbox failure. When sponsor Agip withdrew their support at the start of the 1997 season, Alboreto was left without a regular drive, but his luck was about to turn at last. Rejoining Joest Racing for a second outing in their Porsche WSC95 prototype, Michele claimed an unexpected victory in the Le Mans 24-hour race partnered by Stefan Johansson and Tom Kristensen. Subsequently, he took a Joest Porsche LM1 to second place at Road Atlanta in 1998, and was part of Joests squad handling the 1999 Audi R8R challenger. His two races yielded a third place in the Sebring 12 Hours (with Johansson and Capello) and a fourth place at Le Mans (with Aiello and Capello).";

It was the following year when he began to cause a stir. Armed with a Dallara-Alfa, he took third place in the Monaco F3 race and then won at Pau before his season tailed off, though he still took third in the overall standings. His 1991 campaign was less successful: a broken wrist in the Monaco F3 race hindered his progress, and he also attempted to race his Ralt in both the French and British series. 
A move into F3000 in 1992 with Nelson Piquets well-funded team saw disappointment for all concerned with Beretta making too many mistakes for comfort. But a move to Forti Corse brought immediate reward as he won the 1993 season-opener from pole at Donington. Thereafter he failed to make the podium and slipped down to finish sixth in the championship. 
Olivier brought much-needed funds to Larrousse for 1994, and he was certainly not outclassed by his team leader Comas. At Hockenheim he came tantalisingly close to scoring a precious championship point, but one race on his money ran out and a succession of rent-a-drivers were taken on to help the team see out the season. 
Since 1996 Beretta has campaigned an ORECA Chrysler Viper with spectacular success. After the heartbreak of losing the GT2 title at the final round in 1997, he made no mistake the following year paired with Pedro Lamy.

Victory in the Formula Ford Festival at Brands Hatch way back in 1986 led to rides with BMW in the FIA world touring car championship, Formula 3 programmes in both Britain and Germany and British F3000. His record in all these disciplines was more than respectable but failed to unlock the doors to a higher echelon, so Roland headed east to continue his racing. He won in touring cars, F3000 and Group C with the SARD Toyota team, the latter category being a particular favourite. 
Sadly Rolands part on the Grand Prix stage was truly tragic, for the chance to show his undoubted talent was cruelly cut short when his Simtek crashed during practice for the San Marino GP at nearly 200 mph following a suspected front-wing failure.";

Certainly the winner of the 1982 Pilote Elf was something of an enigma during his years in French Formula 3 between 1983 and 1986, the young Belmondo putting in some useful performances without being quite on the pace of each new batch of hot-shots as they leap-frogged over him on their way up. 
Eventually, in 1987, he followed more stellar talents into F3000 and scored a fifth place at Pau with a GBDA Lola, but nothing concrete was achieved during the next three seasons save a single sixth place in the Le Mans round in 1990. A disastrous 1991 season with the Apomatox teams Reynard was hardly ideal preparation for his unexpected elevation to the Grand Prix ranks, but he settled into the second March in the first half of 1992 surprisingly well - ironically his best performances for the team were at Hockenheim and the Hungaroring, his last two races before his money ran out. Charged with bringing the car home in one piece at all costs, Pauls sensible approach helped to keep the team afloat financially, and even his greatest detractors would admit that he had done a sound job in difficult circumstances. Just as it seemed that Paul would join the ranks of ex-Formula 1 drivers, he became part of the new Pacific Grand Prix team for 1994. Unfortunately, the car was never remotely competitive and his frustrating second spell in F1 was largely spent accumulating a string of non-qualifications along with team-mate Gachot. 
Following his stab at F1, Belmondo turned his attentions to GT racing; initially he drove a Ferrari GT40 in 1996, before setting up his own team running Chrysler Vipers. The high point to date came late in 1999, when Paul won the FIA GT round at Homestead, beating the works cars.";
108;"Andrea de Cesaris";7;31.5.1959;"Рим";"Лацио";"область";;"Андреа де Чезарис";"";"";"De Cesaris spent more than a decade trying to live down a reputation as a wild and erratic performer, who was only competing in the top echelon by virtue of his powerful sponsorship connections. As is usually the case, there was certainly more than a grain of truth in the snipings, though by the early nineties the enfant terrible had matured into a very professional performer.
A former world karting champion, Andrea was campaigning a Ralt run by Tiga's Tim Schenken in the 1978 British BP F3 championship at the age of 18. He continued in the formula the following year with Team Tiga's March, and though he won six rounds of the Vandervell series the silly mistakes which were to become a feature of his Formula 1 career were already apparent, spoiling his championship chances, and he finished second to Chico Serra at the season's end.
Joining Ron Dennis's Project Four outfit for the 1980 season, de Cesaris enjoyed a successful debut in the New Zealand Pacific series, winning both races at Pukekohe, before racing a March 802 in Formula 2. Though paired with Serra, it was the Italian who soon gained the upper hand and number one treatment in the team. His vast potential was there to be seen, and once a problematical tyre situation was eradicated Andrea looked a real prospect, winning the final race at Misano and a well-earned promotion to the McLaren team newly acquired by Dennis for 1981.
The season began badly when he crashed into Prost on the first lap at Long Beach, and roller-coastered downhill as the number of accidents mounted alarmingly. In most cases it would have been 'goodbye and thank you very much', but luckily for Andrea he was welcomed back by Alfa Romeo, for whom he had made his Grand Prix debut at the end of 1980. Although there were still many moments of desperation, in his two seasons with the team de Cesaris came up with some excellent performances, including a great drive at Spa in 1983, when he comfortably led the first half of the race before trouble hit. With the Alfa operation siphoned off to Pavanello's Euroracing in 1984, Andrea was found a place in the Ligier team, where all the bad traits and indiscipline which had been largely eradicated the previous year were soon to return. He was extremely lucky to emerge unharmed from a huge barrel-rolling crash in Austria in 1985, and after one more race Guy Ligier replaced him with Philippe Streiff.
Nothing if not a survivor, de Cesaris was back once more in 1986, this time leading the Minardi team, but it was to be an uncomfortable year in which he was overshadowed by team-mate Nannini despite first call on equipment. Team-hopping was an art at which de Cesaris was to become well-practiced. Fetching up at Brabham in 1987, he proved the talent was still there, with excellent performances at Spa, Estoril, Jerez and Mexico, but so were the equally lacklustre displays. It was the same sweet and sour cocktail at Rial in 1988, with an impressive drive at Detroit, where he showed remarkable restraint to finish fourth. Andrea then had a two-year tenure at Dallara, where the Jekyll and Hyde character was ever more in evidence, with Mr Hyde playing the dominant role.
Just when it seemed that the game was up and de Cesaris' chequered Grand Prix career could go no further, he was a shock choice for Jordan for 1991. If the new team was a revelation then so was Andrea, who drove better than ever before, coming very close to a second place at Spa before his engine failed at the death. Though not retained by Jordan, his performances brought him to Tyrrell for 1992, where his racecraft and new-found maturity helped bring the team much-needed points on four occasions. Sadly, 1993 found Tyrrell in deep trouble despite the promise shown by a new Yamaha engine, and there was little sign of the de Cesaris we had seen in the previous two years.
After 14 seasons and close on 200 starts he began the 1994 season without a drive but, with Jordan's Eddie Irvine suspended, Andrea was soon back in business, albeit for just two races. At Monaco he drove sensibly to take fourth place, which must have helped his cause no end as Sauber searched for a replacement for the injured Wendlinger. Apart from a sixth place in France, however, it was hardly an auspicious Grand Prix swansong, for there were to be no more Formula 1 comebacks.";

He then became a stalwart on the F3000 scene from 1990 to 1992, making the best of things when he was in the right team but maybe the wrong chassis (a Ralt in 1991 and a Lola in 1992). Jean-Marc proved he was capable of being blindingly quick when circumstances allowed and his wins at Pau and Vallelunga were just reward for his efforts. 
At the end of 1993, at the relatively late age of 30, this amiable Frenchman finally realised his ambition to race a Formula 1 car, buying a ride for the years last two Grands Prix, having been patiently waiting for another opportunity following the March teams collapse before the start of the season. 
Though he had hoped that his two drives for Minardi would lead to a full Grand Prix season in 1994, for he had access to the government fund set up in the wake of the ban on tobacco sponsorship introduced in France, Jean-Marc was forced to bide his time racing a BMW 318 in the French Supertourisme series, finishing a creditable fifth in the points standings. His chance to return to the Grand Prix stage came with Simtek, when he filled the seat tragically vacated by Roland Ratzenberger, and then by Andrea Montermini, who had crashed on his debut in Spain. Never able to do better than qualify on the last row of the grid, Jean-Marc nevertheless plugged away with great enthusiasm, his ninth place on his debut in France actually being the teams best result all year. However, when his sponsorship money eventually ran out, he was replaced by Mimmo Schiattarella. 
Gounon has since forged a rewarding career in sports car racing, excellent performances in 1996 with a Ferrari and the following season in a McLaren F1 GTR leading to a seat in the semi-works Persson Motorsport Mercedes CLK. In 1999 he raced a DAMS Lola and, variously paired with Eric Bernard and Christophe Tinseau, scored wins at Donington, Brno, the Nurburgring and Kyalami.";

Alliot spent two seasons in the shadow of one Alain Prost before clinching the Formule Renault title in 1978. The next four seasons were devoted to climbing the ladder in F3. He was third in the French championship in 1979 and spent three seasons contesting the European championship (finishing fifth, third, then fifth again) before a season in F2 in 1985, where he was always quick but prone to error in the ORECA Martini. The highlight of his season came with his third place at Le Mans, sharing the Kremer Porsche with Mario and Michael Andretti. 
Alliot moved up into the big league with the underpowered, underfinanced RAM-Hart but his two seasons with the team were littered with shunts and no points were scored. So it was back to ORECA and F3000 for 1986, Alliot taking his March to victory in the round at Spa, but then an opportunity to drive for Ligier arose after Laffltes accident at Brands Hatch. Philippe caused a stir by keeping pace with Arnoux and scored a point in Mexico - which was enough to interest Larrousse, for whom he raced for the next three seasons. He then returned to Ligier, where chassis of various appellations (JS33, JS33B and JS33C) were all subjected to a comprehensive crash-testing programme. 
It was therefore surprising that he should have been invited to join Jean Todts Peugeot sports car team for 1991-92. Paired with Mauro Baldi, he won three times (Suzuka 91, Donington and Magny Cours 92) as the French manufacturer trampled all over meagre opposition and the sports car championship headed for extinction. Far from being an endangered species, a more self-confident Alliot then bounced back into Formula 1 for the third time at the age of 39 with Larrousse. At the behest of his former sports car entrant, Philippe was brought into the McLaren-Peugeot squad for 1994, but his role was largely confined to testing, Ron Dennis preferring the talents of Martin Brundle. Eventually he did get one race - deputising for the suspended Hakkinen in Hungary - before reappearing for Larrousse, just once, at Spa. Realising that his days in Grands Prix were over, Alliot hit the French Supertourisme trail in 1995 with a works Peugeot. 
In 1996 Philippe raced in the Le Mans 24 Hours for Courage Competition, but the car he was sharing was eliminated after a stuck throttle pitched it into the wall (with Alliot at the wheel) when holding fourth place.";

Potential World Champions were two a penny, as the conveyor-belt churned out hot-shots one after another: the Ferte brothers, Grouillard, Raphanel, Alesi, Bernard, Trolle, Comas - and Dalmas. 
The reigning French Formule Renault champion, Yannick took the number two seat to Raphanel in the all-conquering ORECA F5 team for 1985 and duly finished second in the championship. Next year it was his turn to lead the team and he won six of the 11 races, impressing all watchers with his flair and speed. 
Moving up to F3000 for 1987, his machinery did not always work as well as one would expect, but when things were right he flew. Victories at Pau and in the final round at Jarama brought him into a slightly disappointing fifth place in the championship, but for Dalmas it mattered little. He had already been given his Grand Prix chance by Larrousse in Mexico, and a fifth place (no points scored being a non-regular driver) in Australia at seasons end made his place in the F1 team for 1988 a formality. 
The year was a personal disaster. Early-season shunts blunted his confidence and then what appeared to be an ear problem that sidelined him towards the end of the season turned out to be a life-threatening bout of Legionnaires disease. 
He returned to the Larrousse equipe for 1989, but a string of non-qualifications led to his leaving the team in mid-season in favour of Alboreto. Taking up a seat at AGS merely hastened his depressing slide and, while he did manage to qualify the car on occasion in 1990, it must have been a great relief when Peugeot offered him the chance to re-establish his career with a place in their sports car team. Paired with Rosberg, he won two races (Magny Cours and Mexico City) and in 1992 he shared the World Sports Car Drivers title with Derek Warwick after winning at Le Mans, Silverstone and Fuji, also finishing second at Monza and Donington. 
With Peugeot competing only at Le Mans in 1993 (where Yannick finished second with Boutsen and Fabi), he drove a Peugeot 405 in the French Supertourisme series, and he continued in 1994, taking fourth overall in the final standings. Undoubtedly the highlight of his year was a second Le Mans win (with Baldi and Haywood for Porsche), for his subsequent brief Grand Prix reappearance for Larrousse passed almost unnoticed. 
Yannick scored a third Le Mans win in 1995 with a McLaren F1 GTR, but concentrated on his drive in the DTM/ITC series with the Opel Joest team. His two seasons in this category brought little reward, however, the frustrated driver dissatisfied with his equipment. 
The 1997 season started with a win in a Ferrari 333SP at Sebring and Dalmas was then delighted to sign for Porsche to race their 911 GT1 prototype. He quickly became the cornerstone of the teams efforts, with his serious and professional approach much admired by all his co-drivers. He formed a particularly strong driver pairing with Allan McNish in 1998 when the Porsche was bettered only by the works Mercedes CLKs. The companys withdrawal from competition in 1999 left Dalmas without a regular drive but he was quickly snapped up by BMW Motorsport, enabling him to notch up a fourth Le Mans win with Pierluigi Martini and Jo Winkelhock in the BMW V12 LMR.";

He came from Japan to contest the 1989 Vauxhall and GM Lotus series, and then F3 with a Ralt, and the high point in this class came in 1991 when he won at Silverstone. 
Three years in F3000 brought steady but hardly spectacular progress, though Hideki took a third at Enna in 1994. People think Im useless, said the ever-smiling Noda as eyebrows were raised when he found a seat at Larrousse at the end of 1994. He did a neat and tidy job in a poor car - a lot better than most people expected. Plans to join Simtek for a series of races in 1995 came to nought when the team folded, and to add insult to injury it appears they had taken his deposit. 
Hideki then switched to the Indy Lights series, where he was quick but erratic. The highlight of his two years in the States came at Portland in 1997 when he became the first Japanese driver to win a CART-sanctioned event. 
In 1998 Noda returned to Japan to race successfully in both Formula Nippon and the All-Japan GT championship, driving the Hoshino teams Ralt in the former and a Toyota Supra with co-driver Wayne Gardner in the latter.";

After six seasons of karting, Francks car racing career was given a flying start in 1987 with second place in the Volant Ekron and the opportunity to move into FF1600. In 1990 he stepped into Formule Renault and finished second in the championship, before two seasons in French F3 with a Dallara-Opel which culminated in his being crowned champion in 1992. 
Joining DAMS in 1993, Lagorce was number two to Panis, and though Olivier was to take the crown Francks role was not entirely subordinate, for he won the final two rounds at Magny Cours and Nogaro to take equal fourth in the series with Gil de Ferran. He switched to the rival Apomatox team in 1994, scoring two fine wins, but in truth he let the championship slip through his fingers after looking a good bet throughout the year. Already the official reserve and test driver with Ligier, Franck was given a tantalising glimpse of Grand Prix racing with a couple of end-of-season drives, but spent 1995 consigned to his Ligier testing role. 
After returning to racing competition in the Renault Spyder series, Franck joined Pescarolo and Collard in the Courage at Le Mans in 1996, taking seventh place. Deciding that he would rather be in a factory-backed sports car than struggling with a back-of-the-grid Formula 1 team, Lagorce abandoned his efforts to find a place on the Grand Prix stage and opted to join Eric Bernard in the DAMS-run Panoz for 1997.

Simple mathematics tell the story: an average of four points from every Grand Prix. Yet despite these staggering statistics, there are plenty of fans who wouldnt give the Frenchman the time of day. Perhaps only Stewart can divide opinion so sharply, and the issues were much clearer in his case, being centred on safety. But as the years roll by, Alain will rightly be lauded as one of the sports absolute greats. Certainly a decade or two hence there will be few, if any, followers of motor racing who will be able to understand the current dismissive attitude of an ill-informed minority towards his wonderful achievements. 
Prosts car racing career had been set on a stellar path from the start. After racing karts in the company of Cheever and Patrese he turned to cars in 1975, enrolling at the Winfield school. He won the traditional Pilote Elf prize of a car for the following seasons Formule Renault series and certainly put it to good use, winning 12 of 15 races. Promotion to Formule Super Renault duly followed, and eight wins later that trophy went on the Prost mantelpiece as well. He moved into Formula 3 in 1978, but the Martini MK21B-Renault was not truly competitive until a close-season revamp saw the car emerge as the MK27. Alain proved virtually unbeatable with it, taking the European and French titles and the all-important Monaco F3 race. He was ready for Formula 1, and McLaren were the first takers. 
In 1980 the team were not in great shape and on the point of total transition, but Prost was unfazed and scored points in his first two Grands Prix. Even in that first season the traits that later served him so well were there: the smooth driving style, the willingness to speak his mind honestly and a genuine concern about the sport and its image. The chance to join Renault for 1981 was too good to turn down and Prost moved in to completely flummox partner Arnoux. Alain scored three wins that year and two more were added in 1982, but there could have been many others if the Renault had not let him down so often. It was largely thanks to Prost that the RE30B had reached such a competitive position, and he was just as formidable a force in 1983 with its successor. Apart from an error at Zandvoort he hardly put a foot wrong, yet still the championship slipped through his fingers at the very last. Renault and the French press pointed the finger of blame at a bemused Prost, who took the only course of action possible and high-tailed it to McLaren, who knew better than to look a gift horse in the mouth. While the Renault F1 effort slid into oblivion over the next two seasons, Alain was busy winning the small matter of 12 Grands Prix. In 1984 he lost out to Niki Lauda by just half a point, but finally cracked it to become the first French World Champion in 1985. 
With Williams-Honda dominant in 1986, few gave Alain any hope of retaining his crown, but he hung in, picking up every point possible and coaxing four wins from the McLaren-TAG to steal the title in Adelaide. The following year even Prosts powers were unable to halt the Williams steamroller, but he did overtake Jackie Stewarts long-standing total of Grand Prix wins in Portugal. Then in 1988 Prost too had Honda power, but with the Japanese V6 came Ayrton Senna. That first season saw a McLaren carve-up, with the pair winning all but one of the 16 races. Senna had the edge and Prost, at times nonplussed, had to settle for second-best for once. It was a different story in 1989; Alain raised his game and the battle was on, especially after a steady deterioration in the drivers relationship. The title was settled in the Frenchmans favour when he subtly chopped the Brazilian at Suzuka. It was truly an awful way to decide a championship, and yet history repeated itself in 1990, except that Alain was now on the receiving end as Senna drove into the back of his Ferrari at the start. This wiped out a seasons truly brilliant endeavour by Prost, who had moved into his new environment and immediately given the Italian team a real sense of purpose. Unfortunately this was not to be maintained in 1991, when Maranello politics and intrigue reached new heights, with Prost locked in bitter off-track arguments. When it finally arrived, the new 643 was disappointing and by the seasons end the Frenchman had been fired for his outspoken views. 
Disillusioned, he took a years sabbatical from the cockpit, despite massive pressure to join Ligier. This move left him plenty of time to weigh up his options and by mid-1992 he had tied up a deal to race for Williams in 1993, expecting to partner Nigel Mansell. Of course it is now history that Nigel chose to vacate his seat, leaving Prost in a very strong position to take his fourth World Championship. In a no-win situation, Alain got the job done in his usual undramatic style, his season yielding thirteen pole positions and another seven wins. With the prospect of Ayrton Senna joining the team in 1994, Prost concluded that he just didnt need the aggravation, and announced that he was going to retire at the end of the season. 
There were tempting opportunities to reconsider. He tested a McLaren-Peugeot early in 1994, but eventually confirmed his decision to retire. In the aftermath of Sennas death he declared that he would not race again but in 1995 he tested for McLaren once more, subsequently joining the team in a test and advisory capacity. With a new era already dawning in Formula 1, Alain then took on a huge new challenge with his purchase of the Ligier team, which was renamed Prost Grand Prix prior to the start of the 1997 season. Alain immediately set about a major overhaul of the underperforming French constructor, moving its base from Magny Cours to the outskirts of Paris. 
Like Jackie Stewart, he is an exacting taskmaster, expecting, perhaps unrealistically, his drivers to match his own standards, and three seasons as a team owner have already taught Prost that any success will have to be earned the hard way.";
117;"Derek Warwick";1;27.8.1954;"Олсфорд";"Хэмпшир (Англия)";"графство";"Derek Stanley Arthur Warwick";"Дерек Уорик";"";"";"Sometimes there seems to be no justice in motor racing. For a driver as committed and talented as Derek Warwick to have toiled for more than a decade and taken part in nearly 150 Grands Prix without even a single victory must be particularly galling. Yet there is no bitterness from the down-to-earth Hampshireman, who in the early days of his Formula 1 career looked a likelier prospect than Nigel Mansell. 
After the hurly-burly of stock car racing, Derek funded his own early career in Formula Ford. He took second place in the 1976 DJM championship in his Hawke, before moving into Formula 3 the following year with a Chevron. In 1978 Warwick became embroiled in a terrific three-way battle with Piquet and Serra, winning the Vandervell F3 championship and emerging as runner-up to Nelson in the BP series. Moving to Formula 2 in 1979 with a Theodore Racing-entered March brought little cheer, but a switch to Toleman for 1980 signalled the start of a great relationship with the emerging team. That first year was in Formula 2, and he won two races (at Silverstone and Monza) as his more experienced team-mate Brian Henton took the coveted European title. Flushed with their success, Toleman made the jump to Formula 1 the following year but it proved to be a tough baptism for Derek, who managed to qualify only at the seasons final race. 
Things could only get better, and they did. In 1982 and 1983 Warwick battled away in the Pirelli-shod turbo car, scrapping ferociously for every place, no matter how far down the field. This fighting spirit no doubt helped to earn him his chance when the call came from Renault to race for them in 1984. Derek was never to get closer to that elusive Grand Prix win than on his debut for the team at Rio, where he was leading comfortably when the suspension collapsed. Somehow that blow seemed to set the tone for a season which failed to meet expectations of both the car and the driver. Then came the worst decision of Warwicks career - to stay with Renault in 1985. The year was a personal disaster, and the offer of a seat at Williams which he rejected and was taken by Mansell instead must always haunt him. When the French team pulled the plug on their Formula 1 effort, Derek was an out-of-work Grand Prix driver. A Jaguar sports car ride was his only realistic option for 1986 but he did a fine job for the team, missing the drivers championship by just one point. However, the tragic death of Elio de Angelis found Warwick making a swift return to the Grand Prix scene with the difficult lowline Brabham BT55, a car with which nobody could have found success. 
Warwick then joined Arrows, who, like their new driver, were still looking for their first Grand Prix victory, and this was their tenth season of trying. In the three years he was to stay with the team, a few worthwhile results were achieved, but the cars were mediocrity personified. A switch to the well-funded but disorganised Lotus team in 1990 was probably the bottom of the barrel for poor Derek, who showed incredible bravery at Monza, where he crashed spectacularly at the exit of the Parabolica, only to calmly walk back to the pits to take the spare car for the inevitable restart, and then at Jerez, where he raced despite Donnellys disturbing accident in practice. 
Derek then took another Formula 1 sabbatical to return to sports car racing, first with Jaguar in 1991 and then the following year with Peugeot, with whom he was to enjoy the sweet taste of victory at Le Mans and also share the drivers championship with team-mate Yannick Dalmas. However, Warwicks cheerful presence was to be found in the Formula 1 paddocks yet again in 1993, as he teamed up with Jack Oliver once more in the renamed Footwork team. The year was better than the team had experienced for some time but, even with the expensive acquisition of the TAG/McLaren active suspension system, the cars were top-six runners at best. 
At the end of the season, rightly no longer interested in Formula 1 if he could not have a competitive car, Warwick stepped back to consider his options, which as it turned out were none, or none that excited him. So he took a year out before signing to drive for Alfa Romeo in the 1995 BTCC. Unfortunately once again it was the story of Dereks career: right car - wrong time. 
Warwick (apart from sharing a Courage at Le Mans with Jan Lammers and Mario Andretti) then took another sabbatical to set up his own BTCC team, Triple Eight Race Engineering, which was to run the works Vauxhall Vectras. Two seasons driving one of the cars brought more frustration than success, though a win at Knockhill in 1998 gave Derek the satisfaction of claiming a BTCC victory before standing down from driving duties to continue in a management role with his team.";

During the 17 seasons that he had spent racing at the highest level, he had matured from a wild and cocksure enfant terrible into a contented and charming elder statesman, happy still to be part of the scene which had changed so much during his marathon innings. 
A former karting whizz-kid who took the world title in 1974, Patrese moved into cars the following season in Formula Italia. He finished runner-up to Bruno Giacomelli and then embarked on a full season of Formula 3 in 1976. The ensuing fierce battle with Conny Andersson for the European championship went all the way to a bitter final round before the title fell to the Italian. Riccardo then enjoyed a successful year in Formula 2 with a Chevron but before long he had been propelled into the Shadow team to replace Zorzi. While his off-track demeanour ruffled a few feathers, there was certainly no doubting his talent behind the wheel. Patrese was part of the new breakaway Arrows team at the start of 1978 and he was sensationally quick, leading comfortably in South Africa until an engine failure robbed him of a deserved victory. Unfortunately his driving still had some rough edges, and in the emotional aftermath of Petersons accident at Monza Riccardo was targeted for blame. The treatment he received would have broken a lesser man, but he simply got on with the job, although in retrospect staying loyal to Arrows could have been his biggest mistake. From 1979 through to 1981 he struggled to find sustained success with cars which showed occasional promise that remained unfulfilled, and secretly he must have regretted turning down the tempting opportunities he was offered in 1978. 
A move to Brabham found him in a truly competitive environment, but a lucky win at Monaco was the highlight of an inconclusive year, disfigured by a rash of mistakes. It was a similar story in 1983, Riccardo tossing away victory at Imola early in the season yet signing off from the Brabham team with a perfect display at Kyalami to show what might have been. He certainly had time to ponder his wasted chances over the next few years as he became caught in a depressing downward spiral, struggling with the Benetton-sponsored Alfa for two seasons before returning to a Brabham team that was beginning its terminal decline. At least he had been able to savour the taste of success in his role as a works driver for Lancia Martini with wins at Silverstone and the Nurburgring in 1982, Kyalami in 1984 and Spa a year later. 
When he was picked for the second Williams drive, most observers felt Patrese was extremely lucky to have been given such an opportunity, and he certainly failed to pull up any trees with the Judd-engined car in 1988. However, the following season, with Mansell off to Ferrari and Renault power at his disposal, a rejuvenated Riccardo appeared. Relaxed and confident, he forged an excellent working relationship with Patrick Head and was largely responsible for the development work which was to bring the Didcot team back to the top of the pile. Certainly he was unlucky not to win at least two races that year, but he put that to rights in 1990 with an emotional win at Imola, helping to erase his painful memories of 1983. Even the return of Mansell in 1991 - which Patrese took with great equanimity - failed to blunt his spirit, and he gave as good as he got, particularly in the first half of the season. Victories in Mexico and Portugal set the seal on what was probably his best-ever year. Statistically the following season, when he was runner-up to Mansell in the World Championship, was more successful, but his performances were less convincing, and he was very fortunate to escape unharmed after a horrifying coming-together with Berger at Estoril, but showed his steel by bouncing back with a win at Suzuka. 
Accepting a lucrative contract with Benetton for 1993, Riccardo found it difficult to rediscover his recent sparkling form. A depressing early-season run was arrested by midsummer, but by then the Benetton management had already decided to dispense with the services of Grand Prix racings most experienced campaigner. 
Riccardo subsequently took a well-paid drive in German Super Touring with Ford, but the Mondeo was never more than a midfield runner. Apart from a one-off return to Le Mans with Nissan in 1997, Patrese has since eased himself into comfortable and well-deserved retirement.";
119;"Fabrizio Barbazza";7;2.4.1963;"Монца";"Ломбардия";"область";;"Фабрицио Барбацца";"";"";"Barbazza earned a reputation as a wild but fast driver in Italian F3, finishing third in the series with a Dallara-Alfa in 1985. Frustrated at the lack of opportunities in Europe, he then took the unusual step of moving across the Atlantic to contest the newly created American Racing Series, which he won. More success was to follow in 1987. Filling a vacancy in Frank Arcieros Indy Car team, Fabrizio took a splendid third place at Indianapolis, earning the accolade of top rookie, and finished twelfth in the final points standings to claim the PPG Rookie of the Year Award. 
Still intent on breaking into Grand Prix racing, Barbazza returned to Europe and scraped around in F3000 before finally securing an F1 drive in 1991, only to endure a dismal time fruitlessly attempting to qualify the AGS. Finding the finance to buy a seat in the Minardi team for 1993, Fabrizio confirmed that he has ability, gaining two valuable sixth places for the team before making way for Pierluigi Martini at mid-season. 
In 1995 Barbazza once again headed Stateside to race, but after finishing eighth in the Daytona 24 Hours, he was very seriously injured in a horrendous multiple accident at Road Atlanta, which destroyed his Ferrari 333SP. Fabrizio spent a year recuperating before announcing to retire from racing. He has subsequently been involved in the design and development of safety features for racing circuits.";
120;"Michael Andretti";24;5.10.1962;"Бетлехем";"Пенсильвания";"штат";;"Майкл Андретти";"";"";"The son of the legendary Mario, Michael followed his father into racing in 1980, first in Formula Ford and then in Super Vee (winning the 1982 championship). He broke into Indy cars the following season, which also saw him partner his father at Le Mans, where the pair finished third in a Porsche with Philippe Alliot. 
Michael was soon making a big impact on the Indy Car scene, scoring the first of 37 wins to date in 1986. From that year through to 1992 - aside from a lean year in 1988, when he was sixth overall - he always finished in the top three places in the points standings, and 1991 proved to be a record-breaking season, with Andrettis Newman-Haas Lola taking eight wins, accumulating a record 234 points and posting single-season earnings of $2,461,734. 
With this pedigree, the former Indy Car champion arrived in the high-profile world of Formula 1 with McLaren in 1993 with great expectations, only to be embroiled in a catalogue of collisions, spins and mechanical gremlins which seemed to sap his confidence visibly race by race. A lack of testing mileage, the FIAs rationing of practice laps and his unfamiliarity with the circuits all told against the pleasant American, who was under pressure to produce results. 
Just as crucial, perhaps, was the difficulty he and his first wife Sandy experienced in coming to terms with the way of life in Europe, preferring to fly back to the States whenever possible. By September he had had enough. Having attained a little credibility by finishing third in the Italian GP, the younger Andretti ended his unhappy sojourn in F1 and headed back home buoyed by the prospect of returning to the familiarity of the Indy Car circuit for 1994 with a new challenger from Reynard. 
Michael lost no time in resuming his winning ways at the season-opener at Surfers Paradise, but (despite another win in Toronto) he seemed ill at ease at Ganassi Racing and it was no surprise when he returned to his spiritual home at Newman-Haas for 1995. In the increasingly competitive world of CART racing, Michael has remained one of the series outstanding drivers. Now happily remarried, he has become the sports elder statesman following the departure of his great rival Al Unser Jnr. 
However, he still has the speed, courage and commitment to show younger pretenders that he cannot yet be discounted as a contender for honours.";
121;"Ivan Capelli";7;24.5.1963;"Милан";"Ломбардия";"область";;"Иван Капелли";"";"";"The dividing line between success and failure in Grand Prix racing can be very narrow indeed, as the charming and popular Capelli has found to his cost. Having been generally perceived as being held back from the winners circle only by the want of a top-flight car, the Italians stock crashed with alarming rapidity when a golden opportunity with Ferrari turned sour. 
Yet another ex-karting ace, Ivan went single-seater racing in 1982, taking sixth place in the Italian F3 championship. This brought him to the attention of Enzo Coloni, who quickly signed the Milanese to race his Ralt-Alfa. It was a stunning year for the team, with Capelli winning all but four of the series 13 races to take the title by the staggering margin of 58 points. With Italy well and truly conquered, Coloni took his charge into the European arena, and once again Capelli triumphed, though much less decisively. His European F3 championship was tainted with allegations regarding the cars legality, and, as he acknowledged, he inherited a couple of lucky wins, including the prestigious Monaco race. 
National Service then interrupted Ivans racing progress, and when he entered the 1985 F3000 series at Vallelunga with a March, he immediately rolled it almost to the point of destruction. Despite the most meagre of budgets, Capelli and his team did an outstanding job and he won the Osterreichring round to earn a couple of Grand Prix drives with Ken Tyrrell late in the season. Somewhat surprisingly, he was not on the F1 shopping list for 1986 and settled into another year of F3000 with the Genoa team, the mid-season arrival of Leyton House sponsorship giving the privateer outfit the boost it needed in its successful championship quest. Capelli made another brief foray into Formula 1 with AGS, but long-term his future was to lie wrapped in the comforting folds of the turquoise-blue Leyton House March Racing Team. In a sense the team was Ivans family; they believed in him and he reciprocated. Growing in stature, he had taken the car right to the front of the grid by the end of the 1988 season, and briefly led the Portuguese GP before taking a superb second place. This progress was temporarily halted in a disappointing year plagued by unreliability and the almost bewildering array of handling problems associated with the March CG891, but Capelli bounced back the following year, finishing second to Prost at Paul Ricard and looking a potential winner at Silverstone until retirement. Ivans final year with the team was spent embroiled in development of the new llmor V10, and it has to be said that some of his performances were less than convincing. With the teams owner having been arrested over financial irregularities in Japan, the future looked bleak, and Capelli stood down for the two end-of-season races happy in the knowledge that he had a Ferrari contract in his pocket for 1992. However, it was to be a season of almost unmitigated misery for poor Ivan, who failed to come to grips with the Ferrari F92A, a car which missed the boat on just about every count. 
Before the season was out, Capelli found himself cast aside in favour of test driver Nicola Larini and his options appeared limited. To everyones surprise he was back on the grid at Kyalami with the Jordan team, reunited with his old boss from Leyton House/March, Ian Phillips. It was to be a brief and unhappy sojourn for the Italian, who crashed very heavily in South Africa and then failed to qualify at Interlagos before an amicable parting of the ways left a crushingly disappointed Capelli to come to the conclusion that he had no Formula 1 future at all when he had not yet reached the age of thirty. 
Capelli picked up the pieces of his shattered career, and joined the Nissan works team to race the 2-litre Primera in the German Super Touring championship in 1995 and 1996, but since then he has been an infrequent competitor, picking up occasional sports car drives to keep his hand in. Ivan still maintains his involvement in Grand Prix racing in a commentary role for Bernie Ecclestones Italian digital broadcasts.";
122;"Toshio  Suzuki";9;10.3.1955;"Саитама";"Сайтама (Канто)";"префектура";;"Тосио Судзуки";"";"";"In 1993 Toshio Suzuki took part in a Grand Prix for the first time at the age of 38, having arranged a two-race deal with Larrousse in place of Philippe Alliot. His aim was to finish, and in that he succeeded, but just to compete at this level must have been a source of great satisfaction for this very popular driver, who had been Japanese Formula 3 champion as far back as 1979. He raced in Europe during 1980-81, and was a leading contender in the Japanese F2 and F3000 series for more than a decade but enjoyed little luck until the 1995 season when at last things went his way, Suzuki winning the All-Japan F3000 series at the last gasp for Hoshino Racing. 
It was in sports car racing that Toshio found his greatest success. After driving Toyotas, he joined Nissan to team up with Kazuyoshi Hoshino, the pair becoming a formidable combination not only at home but also on the international stage, their proudest triumph coming in the 1992 Daytona 24 Hours when, with Masahiro Hasemi, they became the first all-Japanese crew to win a major race. 
The veteran has recently been a regular in the All-Japan GT championship, racing a Toyota Supra, and a member of the driver line-up for the Japanese giants Le Mans assault. After finishing ninth in the 1998 Le Mans 24 Hours with the Toyota GT-One, Toshio teamed up again with Ukyo Katayama and Keiichi Tsuchiya to finish a fine second a year later.";
123;"Thierry Boutsen";19;13.7.1957;"Брюссель";"Брюссельский (Фландрия)";"столичный округ";;"Тьери Бутсен";"";"";"With no family racing background, Thierry went to the Pilette racing school where he soon became a star pupil and set out on a Formula Ford career. In 1978 the young Belgian raced a Crossle in the Benelux countries, winning 15 of his 18 races, which brought him to the attention of his boyhood idol Jacky Ickx. With his help, Boutsen found a Formula 3 ride in 1979, but the season was fraught with troubles until a spectacular performance in the final round at Jarama, where he matched European champion Alain Prost. This one drive was enough to persuade the works Martini team to sign him in place of the little Frenchman, who was off to McLaren, and the new season began well, with three wins in the first four races, but when March launched their new wing car, a depressed Boutsen was powerless to prevent himself being overhauled by the determined Michele Alboreto. 
Stepping up into Formula 2 with a works March in 1981, Boutsen was the surprise of the championship, winning races at the Nurburgring and Enna, and finishing runner-up once more, this time to Geoff Lees. Opting to race for Spirit in 1982 was something of a gamble which didnt quite come off, but his brilliant wins at the Nurburgring, Enna and especially Spa marked him down as an immediate Grand Prix prospect. Thierrys hopes of racing the Spirit F1 car in 1983 were dashed when Johansson got the nod but he managed to finance a ride with Arrows, with whom he was to stay for three more seasons, quietly but impressively getting on with the job in hand. The car was never really competitive, but Boutsen was always a contender for points, and when Benetton signed him it was a long-overdue promotion. 
Results in his first season with Benetton, 1987, were a mite disappointing, with niggling mechanical problems restricting the teams progress, while in 1988 his position was somewhat eroded by the arrival of the gregarious Nannini, but Boutsen still finished third behind the dominant McLarens on four occasions. 
Joining Williams with Renault power for 1989 offered Thierry his big chance, but though he did little wrong - indeed he took two brilliant wins in torrential rain at Montreal and Adelaide - it seemed that he didnt quite fit the bill at Didcot, rather unfairly being compared with Mansell. In 1990, already feeling under-appreciated at Williams, he scored an absolutely superb win in the Hungarian GP, proving he had nerves of steel by fending off Sennas late challenge, before he took the only feasible option open to him and signed a two-year deal with Ligier. Despite a massive budget, Ligier made a hash of things as usual, particularly in 1991 when Thierry just kept his head down hoping things would improve. In fact they did somewhat the following season, when Renault engines became available, but such was the strained atmosphere within the team that at the end of the year the Belgian was probably glad to be out of it. Without a drive for 1993, Thierry was soon called into the Jordan line-up, replacing the crestfallen Capelli. However, it was to be an undistinguished swansong, which came to a sad end when Boutsen retired from his farewell Formula 1 race at Spa on the first lap. 
In 1994 and 1995, Thierry competed in the German Super Touring championship, but his Ford Mondeo was unable to challenge the dominance of Audi and BMW. On a wider stage, at Le Mans in 1995, he shared the sixth-place Kremer K8-Porsche with Hans Stuck and Christophe Bouchut. A return to sports cars and the sharp end of competition came in 1996 when Thierry was again paired with Stuck, in a works Porsche 911 GT1. After a second place at Le Mans, the experienced duo took end-of-season wins at Brands Hatch and Spa. Although eight top-six finishes were achieved the following year, no victories were forthcoming, and the seasoned campaigners were both dropped from the works squad. 
Boutsen therefore headed over to the States to race a Porsche 911 GT1 in selected US GT championship events, also driving Toyotas latest Le Mans challenger, the GT-One. He returned in 1999 for another outing in one of the potent Japanese machines, but the race ended in near-disaster for the Belgian when his car was nudged into the barriers by a back-marker. Suffering from cracked vertebrae in his back, he decided it was time to call it a day and retired to spend more time with his second wife and young family, and concentrate on his aviation business.";
124;"Marco Apicella";7;7.10.1965;"Сассо-Маркони (близ Болоньи)";"Эмилия-Романья";"область";;"Марко Апичелла";"";"";"This diminutive Italian was a contemporary of Caffi, Tarquini, Larini and Barbazza in the national F3 series in 1984-85. He was certainly quick but also somewhat erratic, sampling three different chassis in 1985 and taking a couple of wins at Misano. In 1986 he was teamed with Larini in Enzo Colonis Dallaras and the young hot-shots dominated proceedings, with Apicella taking the runner-up slot. 
If he felt something of a bridesmaid in that formula, it was as nothing to his experiences in the FIA F3000 championship, where he spent five seasons (1987-91) as the man most likely to, searching in vain for a win before he joined the wave of Europeans invading the Japanese F3000 series in a bid to revive his career. Marco was a surprise choice for a one-off Jordan ride in the 1993 Italian GP, and his race was short lived, Apicella being eliminated in a first-lap melee. 
Tangible success came at last for the Italian when he was crowned 1994 All-Japan F3000 champion driving for the Dome team. Although the following year, when he raced the 5-Zigen teams Reynard, proved less successful, Apicella continued competing in Formula Nippon, turning in some solid performances, while testing the Dome F1 challenger which ultimately failed to make the grid. 
In 1999 he reappeared in Europe to take occasional drives in a Riley & Scott sports car, bagging a fourth place at Brno. His vast experience was also put to good use in the newly inaugurated Italian F3000 series, Marco winning rounds at both Vallelunga and Misano for Monaco Motorsport.";

Drawing a blank in his first season of F3000, Naspetti then came under the wing of Eddie Jordan in 1990 but again disappointed, scoring but a single point. It was a different story in 1991 when, with the advantage of a Heini Mader-tended Cosworth engine in his Forti Corse Reynard, the Italian came out of his shell to string together a run of four victories at Enna, Hockenheim, Brands Hatch and Spa. Still with Forti, he stayed in the formula for a fourth year in 1992, winning at Pau, but then jumped at the chance to join the Formula 1 March team, replacing Paul Belmondo in mid-season. Emanuele proved surprisingly quick to adapt, clinging tenaciously to his team-mate Wendlinger for most of his debut race at Spa. 
Naspetti spent much of 1993 frustrated at the lack of a Formula 1 drive, but did make a one-off appearance for Jordan in Portugal as a reward for his efforts as a test driver. 
Since then he has carved out a niche for himself in the Italian Superturismo series with a BMW 320L A controversial stop-and-go penalty in the final round cost him the chance of the title in 1996, but he made amends the following year as he dominated the championship. Emanuele subsequently hankered after a return to single-seaters and visited the States to sound out the possibility of a ride in CART but, thus far, he has continued to race in Italy, where his BMW has had to play second fiddle to Giovanardis Alfa Romeo.";

A Formula Ford champion in 1981 in his native Brazil, Gugelmin followed his friend and ex-karting rival Ayrton Senna to Europe, initially taking the same route to the top - FF1600 and FF2000, then Formula 3 with West Surrey Racing in 1985. Fast, safe and above all consistent, Mauricio took the title, and rounded off the season, and his F3 career, with a win in the prestigious Macau GP. 
Gugelmin moved into F3000 with West Surrey Racing for 1986, enduring a frustrating year fraught with problems, but his fortunes improved the following season. Now running a works Ralt-Honda with fellow Brazilian Roberto Moreno, he won the opening round at Silverstone, but a spate of mid-season non-finishes left him fourth in the points at seasons end. 
Mauricio then joined the Leyton House March team and was happy to remain with them for four seasons in which he experienced the highs (third place in Brazil in 1989) and lows (a run of non-qualifications in 1990 when the cars sensitive chassis proved nearly impossible to set up) of F1. By the end of 1991 the whole organisation was crumbling after 18 months of internal dissent and personnel changes, and Gugelmin took his leave to join his old mentor Ian Phillips at Jordan. The year was a debacle for the team as they struggled with the Yamaha engine, but Mauricio earned their respect by never giving less than his best. 
Without a drive for 1993, Gugelmin made his Indy Car debut in the last three races of the season, and while he enjoyed little success he showed enough promise to decide that this was where his racing future now lay. 
Despite a minimal budget, he joined Ganassi Racing in a team run quite separately from that of star driver Michael Andretti. The lack of a helping hand from an experienced team-mate and the absence of shared technical feedback (though there was some cross-fertilisation by mid-season) no doubt frustrated the Brazilian, who must have been pleased to out-qualify his illustrious peer on more than one occasion. 
In 1995 Mauricio moved to the small but promising PacWest Racing Group and really got moving with a career-best second place in the season-opener in Miami. Crucially this cemented his sponsorship for the year, and allowed him to face the season with renewed confidence. At Indianapolis Mauricio showed just how well he had adapted to oval racing, leading the most laps in the race before handling problems caused him to fade to sixth at the finish. Thereafter his form was patchy, but he bounced back at Laguna Seca with a strong third place. 
Without doubt one of the most popular drivers in the series, Gugelmin has since remained a fixture with Bruce McCaws Californian-based team. Thus far his best season Stateside was in 1997, when the Brazilian posted his only CART victory to date at Vancouver and finished fourth in the championship.";

Eric then briefly tasted the German F3 series but really made a name for himself in the Zakspeed BMW Junior team, winning the German championship, with the added highlight of a victory in the Spa 24 Hours with Theys and Martin.
After another season of touring cars with Schnitzer BMW, Eric made the break into single-seaters at last with an F3000 drive with GA Motorsports in 1989. He was to enjoy two happy years with the team, taking second place in the 1990 championship after three wins (Pau, Birmingham and Nogaro).
With long-time sponsors Lease Plan behind him, Eric joined the newly formed Lambo team for a crack at Grands Prix in 1991. The car was never a competitive proposition, but mysteriously it ran very well at Imola, van de Poele holding a secure fifth place until a fuel pump failure on the last lap. For 1992 Eric threw in his lot with the by now distinctly shaky Brabham team for another frustrating string of non-qualifications, before jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire with a Fondmetal team also facing imminent extinction.
He was on the sidelines for much of 1993, but landed a deal to lead the Nissan Primera challenge in the 1994 British touring car championship. It was to be a tough old season as the team struggled to optimise the car. Frustrated at the lack of progress, Eric quit the series in mid-season, though it was not to harm his long-term prospects with the Japanese manufacturer.
Early in 1995, sharing a Ferrari 333SP with Fermin Velez, he won the Sebring 12 Hours (also taking a stint in the Baldi/Alboreto fourth-place car). When the season got into full swing Eric was back behind the wheel of a Primera, this time in the Spanish touring car championship. With the car now a much more serious contender, van de Poele enjoyed two competitive seasons in the series, but another win at Sebring (this time with a Riley & Scott) left him itching for a return to the more potent prototype classes.
The Belgian joined Wayne Taylor in the Doyle Risi Racing Ferrari 333SP to contest the Professional Racing Series in America in 1998 and won rounds at Las Vegas and Road Atlanta. Teaming up with Schiattarella at Team Rafanelli for 1999, Eric won the opening round of the American Le Mans Series at Atlanta, but his season was then dealt a serious blow when a jammed throttle caused a heavy crash when he was testing the works Nissan in preparation for the Le Mans 24-hour race, which left him sidelined for three months with cracked vertebrae.";

After finishing fourth in the 1983 series, he graduated to the all-conquering Marlboro-backed ORECA team the following year and swept to the title as was the established custom for the chosen incumbent, though it was a close-run thing, Grouillard edging out his rival Frederic Delavallade by just two points, 108 to 106. 
Rustling up enough budget for half a season in F3000 with ORECA in 1985, Grouillard made a good impression, coming close to a win at Enna. It was much the same the following year, when he was able to take part in only four races; he could have won at Mugello but made a mistake and ended up in fourth place. Back with ORECA again in 1987 he showed speed, but was rather overshadowed by team-mate Dalmas, who was on a somewhat quicker path to Formula 1. But Olivier was nothing if not persistent, and for 1988 he got himself into the well-funded GDBA team, running works-backed Lolas. He finished runner-up to Roberto Moreno, winning two races and putting in some superb performances. 
At last Grouillard found himself in Formula 1 with Ligier, but after a bright start relations between the tempestuous youngster and his volcanic proprietor broke down and the driver was forced to seek alternative employment with Osella. The next two seasons were spent trying to qualify for races above all else, and after the briefest of flirtations with the almost extinct AGS team the future looked bleak. 
Once again Grouillard dug himself out of a corner, finding the cash to join the underfinanced Tyrrell team. Freed from the perils of qualifying, he had a car that at the very least he could go racing with, but Olivier was overwhelmingly outperformed by team-mate Andrea de Cesaris and succeeded only in attracting criticism for his bad track manners when being lapped. 
For 1993 Grouillard took himself off to the States for a full season of Indy Car racing but failed completely to make a worthwhile impression, finishing 28th in the points standings. 
The Frenchman returned to Europe in 1994 and scratched around for a suitable ride. He competed at Le Mans in a Venturi 600LM and saw a huge upturn in his fortunes in GT racing. Having split with Giroix Racing in mid-1995 to join Dave Price, he finished the year with three straight wins at Silverstone, Nogaro and Zhuhai in China, sharing a Harrods-backed McLaren F1 GTR with Andy Wallace. The team stayed together for 1996 and more good top-six finishes were achieved, although there was only one outright win (at Silverstone). 
In 1997 Grouillard took the opportunity to race a works Toyota Supra in the All-Japan GT championship, and partnered the Andrettis, father and son, in their unsuccessful attempt to win the Le Mans 24-hour race with the Courage C36-Porsche.";

Now with substantial backing, Modena moved straight into F3000 with the Onyx team and he took the championship at the first attempt, winning three races (at Vallelunga, Birmingham and Imola), but it was the way he went about the whole business that marked him as a special talent. 
Much was expected of the tousled-haired Italian when he entered Grand Prix racing but after an end-of-season ride with Brabham he was forced to endure a discouraging learning year in 1988 with the uncompetitive EuroBrun before being given a chance to really show what he could do with Brabham in 1989. 
He finished in third place at Monaco, but the team lacked the financial resources to progress, and Stefano then marked time until 1991 when he moved to a Tyrrell team newly equipped with Honda power. Things started well with yet another superb display at Monaco, which ended with a broken engine when he lay second behind Senna, and then second place in the next race in Canada, but as the season wore on Modena seemed to lose heart too easily. 
It was some surprise when he was signed to drive the Jordan-Yamaha in 1992, and it was to be a troubled season for the team which found the enigmatic Italian temperamentally unsuited to the situation. He scored a point in the last race of the year but was consigned to the wilderness for 1993, racing a BMW in the Italian touring car championship. 
All was not lost for Modena, however, his excellent form in the Alfa Romeo T155 during the early part of 1994 gaining the Superturismo driver a passport to the higher-profile DTM late on in the season. He made a sensational debut at AVUS, qualifying third and winning both heats, thoroughly eclipsing the established Alfa aces. Naturally, in light of his drives in the series final three rounds, Stefano was signed to race for a full DTM/ITC season with hopes high for even greater success. In reality 1995 saw Alfa lost in a technical mire, and in common with his colleagues Modena generally had to play second fiddle to both Mercedes and Opel. 
Subsequently Modena, who had harboured hopes of gaining a ride in CART, has been a mainstay of the German Super Touring championship. The 1997 season with the ageing Alfa 155 was a disaster and the arrival of the 156 model the following year rarely allowed him to finish in the top ten, but 1999 saw an upturn in the Italians fortunes as the 156 at last became a competitive proposition.";

For 1987 he was well prepared, surging out of the blocks with three wins in the first four races, but his season then tailed off and Enrico Bertaggia pipped him to the title. Stepping up to F3000, Chiesa struggled in 1988, notching just a single point, but things improved the following year, Andrea winning at Enna and finishing second at Vallelunga to claim sixth place in the final points standings. 
His third season in the formula, with Paul Stewart Racing, was much the same and he managed seventh in the final table, but his fourth, in 1991, was an utter disaster, Chiesa failing to score even a point with a competitive Reynard. But such are the vagaries of motor racing that when the Formula 1 team line-ups were confirmed for 1992, Andrea was confirmed at Fondmetal. He was out of his depth and his record of three starts (two spins, one collision) and seven DNQs tells the sorry tale. For Chiesa the F1 dream was over, but he briefly reappeared in 1993, racing in the opening round of the Indy Car series in Surfers Paradise, Australia. 
After three years away from the sport Chiesa briefly returned to the track in a Riley & Scott with Alex Caffi at Laguna Seca in 1996. The partnership was successfully renewed in 1998 when the pair scored a couple of third places in the ISRS series at the Paul Ricard and Le Mans (Bugatti) rounds.";

Progressing through the single-seater formulae, the pint-sized Dutchman took the 1978 European F3 championship by the narrowest of margins with a Ralt, earning a chance with the restructured Shadow team alongside Elio de Angelis for 1979. The cars were not competitive, and Lammers found little more joy during his associations with ATS, Ensign and Theodore over the next two seasons, although he startled the Formula 1 fraternity at Long Beach in 1980 by qualifying his car fourth on the grid. 
After his Grand Prix career had fizzled out, Jan enjoyed a productive spell in the Richard Lloyd Porsche sports car team before having a crack at Indy Car racing late in 1985 . However, he found his greatest success in the TWR Jaguar team, partnering John Watson to three wins (Jarama, Monza and Mount Fuji) in 1987, and winning Le Mans in 1988 with Dumfries and Wallace. He also won the Daytona 24-hour race for Jaguar twice (1988 and 90). After racing in Japanese F3000 in 1991, Lammers joined the Toyota sports car team for 1992, and made an unexpected return to F1 at the end of the year with March. But plans for a full Grand Prix season in 1993 came to nought when the financially bereft Bicester team was finally forced to close its doors, leaving him to take in a limited programme of European F3000. 
Jan was a somewhat surprising choice to race the TWR Volvo estate alongside Rickard Rydell in the 1994 BTCC, and though excellent progress was made in the cars debut year Lammers still hankered after a single-seater career. The Dutchman kicked off 1995 with a win in the F3000/F2 invitation race at Kyalami, and then took second place in the Sebring 12 Hours in a Ferrari with Bell and Wallace before he lined up with Vortex for a projected full season in F3000. Unfortunately, Jan rarely rose above the midfield positions and quit in frustration after just three races. 
Since 1996 Lammers has concentrated on sports car and GT racing, initially with the factory Lotus team and latterly with the Konrad Motorsports Lola.";
134;"Nelson Piquet";2;17.8.1952;"Рио-де-Жанейро";"Рио-де-Жанейро";"штат";"Nelson Piquet Souto Maior";"Нельсон Пике";"";"";"Three world titles testify to the standing of Nelson Piquet, yet many begrudge him his successes, feeling they were not earned in the manner of a true champion. Of course the Brazilian couldnt have cared less. Racing above all to please himself, he went about things in his own way and that approach generally paid dividends. Never happier than when he had some technical advantage to exploit, Nelson felt no embarrassment at using that edge to beat his hapless rivals. 
Having raced karts and Super Vee cars in Brazil, Nelson came to Europe in 1977 to tackle the European F3 series, winning two rounds after switching to a Ralt chassis. The following year he concentrated on F3 once more, this time in Britain. His initial object was to beat his Brazilian rival Chico Serra, who was getting a good press back at home, but eventually it was Derek Warwick who was to be his sternest challenger for the two championships on offer that year. They ended up taking one apiece, but by now Nelson was interesting Formula 1 teams. Mo Nunn gave him a debut in his forgiving Ensign, before the heavy steering of the BS Fabrications McLaren posed more searching questions. However, his practice performance in the third Brabham-Alfa at Montreal prompted Bernie Ecclestone to offer him a contract for 1979. 
A superb drive in the Race of Champions took him into second place, and though the Grand Prix season yielded little by way of hard results Nelson was clearly a driver destined for the very top. When Lauda quit towards the end of the season Brabham did not have far to look for a new team leader to handle the Cosworth-powered BT49 in 1980. Nelson took three Grand Prix wins and finished runner-up to Alan Jones that year, and was to go all the way in 1981. After a tense and closely fought season, Piquet typically did just enough to edge out Carlos Reutemann in the final race at Caesars Palace. Realising that turbo power was now a necessity, Brabham spent the 1982 season bringing their new BMW-engined car to a competitive state - something achieved when Nelson won in Montreal - and then trying to make it reliable. The knowledge gained was then incorporated into the design of Gordon Murrays flat-bottomed 1983 contender which was tailored to the mid-race refuelling tactics the team had pioneered the previous year. At the wheel of the splendid little BT52, Piquet battled with Prost for the title, whittling away the Frenchmans lead before taking the crown at the last gasp at Kyalami. In 1984 the Brabham was no match for the McLarens and even Nelson was left in their wake but, digging deep, he conjured up back-to-back wins in Montreal and Detroit to salvage something from a disappointing year. The end of the superb Piquet-Brabham relationship came in 1985, with Nelson hamstrung by running uncompetitive Pirellis, but there was one last win, at Paul Ricard, when the hard-compound Italian tyres held sway. 
Piquet was ready to better his financial position and signed for Williams for 1986. The season should have been a walk-over for the Didcot team, but the atmosphere soon became strained as Nigel Mansell refused to play second fiddle and set about launching his own title bid. The upshot was that Alain Prost stole the championship at the death, leaving Nelson fuming over Williams indecisive handling of team tactics. Honda were not pleased either, and would switch to McLaren at the end of the following season. Piquet knew the score in 1987, and set about winning the title despite Mansell. With a good deal of fortune and some help from his luckless team-mate, Nelson did just that. His third title may have been achieved more by stealth than by absolute speed, but the results justified the means in Piquets book. A two-year spell at Lotus was a complete disaster for all concerned. The massive retainer Nelson picked up from Camel was out of all proportion to his on-track return, and while his bank balance may never have been higher than it was at the end of 1989, never was his stock so low. His subsequent inclusion in the Benetton team for 1990 was greeted with huge surprise, but as the season wore on the wisdom of the move became apparent. Nelson struck up a good working relationship with John Barnard and the pair brought the Benetton B190 to a very competitive pitch, Nelson exploiting others misfortune to win both the Japanese and Australian GPs. Even his sternest critics were forced to admit that his drive in Adelaide was right out of the top drawer. He was to take one more very fortuitous (but highly satisfying) win at Mansells expense in Canada the following year before being swept away amid the personnel changes that engulfed the team that season. 
With no suitable F1 offers available, Piquet decided to try his hand at the Indianapolis 500 in 1992. Unfortunately a huge crash in practice left him with very badly crushed feet and legs, easily the most severe injuries he had suffered in his long career, and his rehabilitation was long and painful. Nelson vowed never to return to the cockpit but, once fit, he was back at the Brickyard in 1993, and by qualifying for the race he finished the job left uncompleted 12 months earlier. 
Competing now mainly for fun, Nelson has since renewed his links with BMW and has raced a 320i tourer in long-distance events both at home and in Europe, usually with Ingo Hoffmann and Johnny Cecotto. Piquet has also made a couple of visits to Le Mans with the Bigazzi McLaren F1 GTR, finishing eighth in 1996 with Cecotto and Danny Sullivan.";

Brought into the Lotus team alongside the brilliant Ayrton Senna, the Japanese driver inevitably appeared in an unfavourable light during his first season, and his number two status continued when Nelson Piquet took over as team leader in 1988-89, but Satoru quietly got on with the job as the fortunes of the Hethel outfit plummeted. His last race for the team was in the wet at Adelaide in 1989, and he astonished everyone as he made a mockery of the conditions to finish fourth and take fastest lap. 
With help from long-time sponsors Honda and Epson, Satoru moved to Tyrrell in 1990, gaining the odd point with the nimble Cosworth car. He then endured a disappointing final year in F1, despite having V10 Honda power, and it was with some relief that he bowed out and retired from the sport, his head held high and no longer having to carry the burden of his fanatical countrymens expectations. 
Since his retirement Satoru, a huge name in Japan after his Grand Prix exploits, has earned millions from endorsements and advertising. He has also taken on the role of team owner, running a PIAA-backed Reynard in Formula Nippon, and has been a mentor to his driver, Toranosuke Takagi, Japans most exciting prospect of the late nineties.";
136;"Emanuele Pirro";7;12.1.1962;"Рим";"Лацио";"область";;"Эмануэле Пирро";"";"";"Something of a nearly-man, Pirros career has been a tale of ups and downs, as the unlucky Italian always seemed to fall short of ultimate success in most of the categories he raced in. That was until he teamed up with Audi at the beginning of 1994 and took the Italian Superturismo championship by storm with his 80 Competition. Three successive titles represented a sweet success for the tall and lanky Roman, whose earlier career exploits had promised so much. 
Moving from karts to Formula Fiat, he won the championship in 1980 before graduating to the European Formula 3 series, taking the runner-up slot behind Euroracing team-mate Larrauri in 1982. When the team went to F1 with Alfa Romeo in 1983, Pirro had to find an F3 ride elsewhere and after a bright start faded to third in the championship. Stepping up to Formula 2 for 1984 with Onyx, he established a good rapport with the team, and stayed with them for F3000 in 1985, victories at Thruxton and Vallelunga earning him a Brabham F1 test which came to nought. So it was back to F3000 in 1986, and second place in the championship behind Capelli, a mid-season slump costing Pirro his title chance. 
Still seeking an F1 ride, Emanuele busied himself with some superb performances in BMW touring cars, and took on the role of test driver for McLaren before replacing Herbert at Benetton midway through 1989. His half-season was not productive enough, and he was dropped for 1990 when Nelson Piquet was signed up, leaving Emanuele to find a place in the Dallara squad for the next two seasons. With no worthwhile results to speak of and, crucially, precious few drives that caught the eye, Pirro found himself passed over in favour of fresher talent in 1992, switching to the Italian touring car championship with a Bigazzi BMW. 
After being synonymous with the BMW marque on and off over the years, his switch to Audi was something of a surprise but it paid off in a big way for both parties, with his aforementioned hat-trick of Superturismo titles. 
Recent seasons have not been as productive for the Italian; with the Audi variously handicapped by weight penalties and restricted to using two-wheel drive, he has endured a lean time of it in the German Super Touring series. 
In 1999 Pirro and team-mate Frank Biela were drafted into the Audi Sport Team Joest sports car squad for Le Mans, where the touring car stars took third place with Didier Theys in the Audi R8R.";
137;"Alex Caffi";7;18.3.1964;"Ровато";"Ломбардия";"область";"Alessandro Caffi";"Алекс Каффи";"";"";"Always the bridesmaid in Italian F3, Caffi was runner-up in both 1984 and 1985, when the lack of a Dallara chassis probably cost him the title, and third behind Coloni stars Larini and Apicella in 1986. Given a chance to race the unwieldy Osella at the Italian GP that season, Alex drove sensibly, kept out of the way and impressed everyone with his approach. 
This led to a full season with the team in 1987. The car was totally uncompetitive, but Caffi plugged away uncomplainingly, quietly learning his trade. A move to the new Dallara team for 1988 brought some good performances in their neat little car, and the following season he seemed to be a star in the making, finishing fourth at Monaco and losing a potential good result at Phoenix when team-mate de Cesaris elbowed him into the wall. 
In retrospect his move to the Arrows/Footwork operation proved to be a complete disaster. The 1990 season was spent marking time and when the Porsche-engined car arrived it was hopelessly overweight and underpowered. Things took a further dive when Alex was involved in a road accident which resulted in a broken jaw, and the atmosphere in the team was not helped when he threatened legal action to reclaim his seat at Hockenheim. A hot property barely two seasons earlier, Caffis career was now on the skids, and after a brief flirtation with Andrea Moda he found himself languishing in the relative obscurity of the Italian and Spanish touring car championships with a works-backed Opel Vectra. 
In 1998 Caffi joined forces with Andrea Chiesa to successfully race a Riley & Scott sports car in the International Sports Racing Series, and he continued to impress in this discipline in 1999 both in Europe and in the USA with his best placings being thirds in the FIA World Sports Car Cup at Spa (with de Lorenzi) and Kyalami (with Larini). In addition he took a fine sixth place at Le Mans in a Courage C52-Nissan prototype, sharing the driving duties with Montermini and Schiattarella.";
138;"Stefan Johansson";36;8.9.1956;"Векшё";"Крунуберг (Смоланд)";"лен";"Stefan Nils Edwin Johansson";"Стефан Юханссон";"";"";"Bright, bubbly and immensely likeable, Stefan Johansson had gathered together all the credentials required to take him to the top of Grand Prix racing. Somehow, though, it never quite happened for him despite golden opportunities with two front-running teams. 
Stefans father raced Mini-Coopers, and the youngster was soon competing in karts before moving up the Swedish racing ladder in various third-hand single-seaters which he frequently had to drive above and beyond their limit to gain a modicum of success. He first hit the headlines in 1976 when still a complete novice by managing to shunt current Formula 3 big-shot Riccardo Patrese out of a European championship round. Stefans F3 progress stuttered on over the next few seasons, with eyebrows raised over his wild and sometimes not so wonderful driving, but he eventually began to make some solid progress before having to return home when his money ran out. 
It was in 1979 that things started to fall into place, for after a poor start to his British F3 championship campaign with a Chevron, a switch to March chassis seemed to work wonders and Stefan was on the pace thereafter. Then came a quite unexpected chance with the Shadow team at the beginning of 1980. In retrospect Stefan shouldnt have taken up the offer for his reputation inevitably suffered when he failed to qualify in Argentina and Brazil, but at least he was able to come back, to a seat in the top Project Four F3 team and went on to win the Vandervell championship after a great tussle with Kenneth Acheson. Understandably on a high, he moved into Formula 2 with a Toleman and finished fourth in the final standings, gaining victories at Hockenheim and Mantorp Park. Joining the Spirit-Honda team for 1982, Johansson looked a good bet for championship honours, but it wasnt to be his year as bad luck seemed to dog his heels throughout the season. 
Stefan moved into Formula 1 with Spirit and Honda in 1983, and by general consensus the Swede did a fine job with a far from sorted machine, but he found himself out of work when Honda abandoned the project to move to Williams. Johansson decided to drive anything and everything in 1984, travelling the globe to race in an effort to prove his worth, and it worked. Tyrrell called him in to replace the injured Brundle before political problems forced the teams withdrawal, and then Toleman gave him an opportunity and were sufficiently impressed to make plans to run him in 1985. In the event the team were unable to obtain tyres, which in truth worked in Stefans favour, for he was available to take over from Arnoux at Ferrari just one race into the 1985 season. This was his main chance and he grabbed it with some gutsy race performances, bringing the car home regularly to earn a contract for 1986. 
His second season was fraught with endless technical problems, but the ever-smiling Swede plugged away, and he was lucky enough to be given a second top-line chance with McLaren in 1987. Again some of his races were excellent, but too often he qualified poorly, leaving himself much to do to retrieve the situation once the racing started. The decision to bring Ayrton Senna in to partner Alain Prost for 1988 saw Johansson seeking employment elsewhere and he could hardly have found a worse berth than Ligier. The season was a write-off and things looked little better in 1989 with the new Onyx outfit, but to Stefans credit he helped to establish the teams credibility with a terrific third place in Portugal. Just to show there is no such thing as loyalty in Grand Prix racing, poor Johansson was dumped just two races into the 1990 season in favour of the well-financed Foitek. 
Desperate to stay in Formula 1, Stefan signed to drive for AGS in 1991, but when the team changed hands he found himself redundant once more, and a few outings for Footwork in place of the injured Caffi did him no favours as the team were in the midst of a crisis not of their own making with the ill-fated Porsche engine. 
For 1992, Johansson found a niche for himself in Indy Car racing with Tony Bettenhausens small team. Over the next four seasons he was generally a midfield runner, but the acquisition of an up-to-date Reynard for 1996 at last gave Stefan a realistic chance of success. In the event it was a largely disappointing year for the Swede and at the end of it he was so disillusioned that he didnt even bother to look for another ride. Johansson soon found enjoyment in his racing again, however, when he won the 1997 Sebring 12 Hours in Team Scandias Ferrari 333SP, and things got even better when he shared Joest Racings Le Mans-winning Porsche WSC95 with Alboreto and Kristensen. 
Although he continues to race in selected sports car events, of late most of Stefans time has been spent setting up and running an ever-improving Indy Lights team. Plans are already in place for Johansson Motorsports to graduate to the CART series, possibly as early as 2000.";
139;"Julian Bailey";1;9.10.1961;"Вулвич";"Большой Лондон (Англия)";"графство";;"Джулиан Бэйли";"";"";"The determination with which Julian Bailey has pursued his career has enabled him to ride out innumerable financial crises as well as serious injuries sustained when a huge crash at Snetterton in 1980 left him with multiple fractures of his arm and leg. By the end of 1981 he was back in business and quicker than ever. Racing in FF1600 in 1982, Julian was involved in a season-long battle with Mauricio Gugelmin which saw him lose out in the RAC championship but gain some recompense by winning the prestigious Formula Ford Festival at Brands Hatch. 
Julians career then got bogged down with a number of seasons spent scratching around in less than competitive cars - notably in F3. But he plugged away waiting for the break which finally came his way with an end-of-season deal to race a Lola in Formula 3000. Bailey took to the category and, with backing from Cavendish Finance, embarked on a full F3000 season in 1987. A superb win at Brands Hatch, his favourite circuit, provided the years highlight, and the credibility which this win brought him led to a seat at Tyrrell for 1988, but as luck would have it the 017 car fielded by the team that year was a poor one and his season was a complete wash-out. 
After some excellent drives for the Nissan sports car team (including a third place at Donington in 1989), Julian scraped up enough cash to buy a ride with Lotus at the start of the 1991 season but, despite picking up a sixth place at Imola, he was dropped in favour of Johnny Herbert. Accepting that Formula 1 would for ever be out of his reach, he concentrated on forging a career in the British touring car championship, enjoying the chance to race a works Toyota in 1993 alongside Will Hoy. 
Unlike some other notable Grand Prix refugees, Julian became a convincing performer in this type of racing, but rarely had the machinery to challenge for the top BTCC honours. 
Bailey found greater success with Toyota down in South Africa during 1996 and 1997, but it failed to gain him the planned return to the BTCC and he has since been spearheading the Lister-Storm challenge in GT racing at home and abroad.";

One belonged to sections of the motor racing press, who saw him as the whingeing, ungracious chip-on-the-shoulder Brit who courted success and disaster in equal measure but was actually a brilliant racing driver, good for endless column inches and therefore a lucrative source of income. The second Mansell belonged to the man in the street, who didnt give a damn about the scribblings of the journalists, but was content merely to revel in the many scintillating displays served up by one of the most brave, committed and entertaining drivers of his age, a man who still retained the common touch even if he was a superstar. In truth, of course, Mansell was a mixture of all these things, it really just depends on your perspective. I prefer to concentrate on the latter persona, for his remarkable deeds in a racing car are of primary concern in a book of this nature. 
Mansells story is well chronicled, but his dogged refusal to give up when the early part of his career seemed to be leading nowhere marked him down as a potential champion, even if his results in Formula 3 at the time indicated otherwise. The man most responsible for helping Nigels career over that crucial first hurdle was none other than Colin Chapman, who knew a good un when he saw one and placed him in the Lotus team as a test driver. When given his Grand Prix debut in Austria, Mansell endured acute discomfort from petrol which leaked into his cockpit to tough it out until the engine failed, and this was the stuff that Lotus needed as they slipped from their pedestal in the early eighties. 
Certainly there were still rough edges, and Mansell made plenty of mistakes, but there were virtues. He absolutely gave his all, in contrast to team-mate de Angelis who could lose heart when his car was not performing. When Chapman died of a sudden heart attack in December 1982, it was a crushing blow to Nigel, not least because he had lost his greatest believer. His level of competitiveness was raised when the team received their new Renault turbo-powered, Gerard Ducarouge-designed car midway through the following season, as he demonstrated in the European GP at Brands Hatch, but he endured a generally unhappy time in 1984. A probable win in the rain at Monaco was thrown away when he slithered into the Armco and there were many at that stage who doubted if he would ever win a Grand Prix. 
His move to Williams in 1985 changed everything. Soon coming to terms with Keke Rosberg, Nigel broke his duck at last, and continued his new-found form into the 1986 season, putting new team-mate Nelson Piquet in the shade with a series of brilliant drives to take five Grand Prix wins. The championship seemed to be there for the taking but a gaffe in the penultimate round in Mexico when he failed to put the car into gear on the grid was to cost him dear. Now under pressure at the final race in Adelaide, poor Nigel had the race covered and the championship within his grasp until a tyre failure sent him crashing out. Undaunted, he predictably bounced back in 1987, this time clocking up six wins in the Williams-Honda, but a practice crash at Suzuka handed the title to team-mate Piquet. The Williams team then lost their Honda engines to McLaren, and Nigel was forced to spend a year in purgatory with the Judd-powered car, though in the rain at Silverstone he drove quite brilliantly into second place. 
Accepting a massive offer from Maranello, Mansell entered Ferrari folklore with a first-time-out win in Brazil, and carried the fight to McLaren with captivating brio. His win in Hungary after a stunning bit of opportunism in traffic was the highlight of a brilliant season which was soured somewhat after a skirmish with Senna in Portugal led to his suspension from the Spanish GP a week later. Greater disenchantment was to follow in 1990, when Alain Prost joined the Ferrari payroll. The little Frenchman hi-jacked the teams attentions with four early-season wins, prompting Mansell to announce his retirement. An offer from Williams to return to Didcot in 1991 was enough to persuade him to continue, and it was a decision he was not to regret. Driving as well as ever before, Mansells slow start to the season eventually counted against him, for despite a mid-season burst of five wins, punctuated by a heart-breaking pit-stop fiasco in Portugal, Nigel was unable to overhaul Senna in the race for the title. 
In 1992 Nigel finally got the job done. With what was undeniably the best car, he fairly scorched away with the championship, taking five straight wins at the start of the season. Apart from an ill-judged clash with Senna in Canada, he hardly put a foot wrong and thoroughly earned his World Championship. Sadly relations with Williams had deteriorated to the point that an agreement could not be reached for Mansell to continue in 1993 and, with the parties seemingly unable (or unwilling) to find a compromise, he headed off to the States and a new life in Indy Car racing with the Newman-Haas Lola. 
Proving all the doubters wrong, Nigel not only won the PPG Cup at his first attempt but - a crash at Phoenix apart - made light of the black art of racing on ovals to such effect that he was almost omnipotent. Mansell was very unlucky to miss out on a first-time win in the Indy 500 at the last gasp when a full-course yellow saw him outfumbled by the wily Fittipaldi. Perhaps more importantly, however, Nigel had found a new environment in which he felt appreciated, and this undoubtedly showed in his contented demeanour. Sadly it was not to last. Penske wheeled out a new car in 1994 which left everyone else trailing in its wake, and Nigels motivation, such a crucial part of his success, appeared to be less than total. The chance to return to Grand Prix racing in the wake of Sennas death proved irresistible but, despite an end-of-season win at Adelaide, Williams decided to stick with Damon Hill and David Coulthard for 1995. 
In hindsight, perhaps, a fully charged Mansell may have been a better choice to challenge Schumachers dominance. Instead a multi-million-dollar marriage of convenience was forged with Marlboro McLaren Mercedes which ended in farce when he first failed to fit properly in the car, and then gave up when the expensively redesigned machine failed to meet his expectations. This rather sad postscript to Mansells Grand Prix career was gleefully pounced upon by his detractors, while, apart from a handful of over-hyped touring car appearances for Ford in the BTCC during 1998, his legions of loyal fans have since been left to pin their hopes on ill-founded rumours of a comeback.";

Certainly it was Grand Prix racings loss when his career was so devastatingly wrecked by a helicopter accident in which his right arm was severed. Surgeons were able to re-attach the limb but controlling an F1 car was now beyond him and the popular Italians misfortune seemed all the more cruel since his Grand Prix prospects had been at their zenith. 
Sandro began his racing activities off road with a Lancia Stratos, before turning to circuit racing in 1981 in Formula Italia. He then took a big jump into Formula 2 with Minardi in 1982, replacing the teams previous star, Michele Alboreto, who had moved into F1 with Tyrrell. Nannini soon proved himself a worthy successor and by the end of the season he had taken a second place at Misano. In 1983 Minardi produced a promising but initially unworkable new car, and Nannini had to resort to the old chassis to take another second place, this time at the Nurburgring. By 1984, still loyal to the team, Sandros F2 career was really treading water, but everyone had seen the talent and Lancia signed him to drive for their sports car team between 1984 and 1986. 
Having dispensed with the services of Pierluigi Martini, Minardi entered two cars in 1986, with Sandro very much the number two (in theory at least) to the experienced Andrea de Cesaris. He was to spend two seasons with the little team, which in truth had little hope of success. However, Sandro made his mark and, unlike a number of other Grand Prix talents, managed to escape to a frontline team before too many seasons at the back of the field could dull his edge. Chosen to partner Thierry Boutsen at Benetton, he proved more than a match for the Belgian, making the rostrum on two occasions. Nannini was thrust into the position of team leader in 1989 and took some time to adjust to the new situation, but once the new Ford engine arrived his season began   • to take off. He won the Japanese GP on a technical knock-out after Senna was excluded following his tete-a-tete with Prost, and then took a fine second to Boutsens Williams in the rain-soaked Australian GP. 
In 1990 Sandro was joined by the experienced and cunning Nelson Piquet who immediately established a rapport with John Barnard in developing the B190. Having been somewhat overshadowed, Nannini suddenly found his form again at Hockenheim, where he led until finally giving best to Senna. The battle with the Brazilian was rejoined in Hungary, where Ayrton crassly elbowed the Benetton out of second place, ending Sandros chances of a win. Certainly the Italians star was in the ascendant, and there was reportedly a Ferrari contract being bandied about, if not for 1991, then certainly for some time in the future. 
It was all to prove academic after the helicopter accident, but Nannini bravely fought back, to the admiration and great pleasure of the motor racing world. In 1992 he raced an Alfa Romeo successfully in the Italian touring car championship, before proving that he was not in the Alfa team on sentiment alone with some fine displays in the 1993 German series, backing his team-mate Larini superbly as they defeated the Mercedes on home territory. 
After a blindingly good start to 1994, the problems of developing the second evolution Alfa Romeo told on Nannini, whose performances became somewhat erratic, but he bounced back to form in 1996, winning seven rounds of the marathon 26-race ITC series to finish third in the championship. 
With the collapse of the ITC, Nannini moved into the FIA GT series for 1997 with a works Mercedes CLK-GTR, but it was a mixed year in which only four second-place finishes were achieved. Although rumours linked him with BMWs Le Mans efforts, Sandro has not raced since.";

Little did they realise that it would be at the wheel of Mercedes touring and sports cars that he would taste success rather than in Grand Prix racing, where two miserable seasons with Zakspeed and a couple of drives with Arrows unfairly left him washed up as a Grand Prix driver at the age of 26. 
Bernd drove a Kremer Porsche in Interserie racing in 1990 and then raced in IMSA for the Joest team, before reviving his career in the DTM with a Zakspeed Mercedes. He switched to an AMG works car for 1992 and was soon considered the fastest driver in the Mercedes squad, but the scintillating form of Larini and the Alfas in 1993 meant his quest for the championship would have to wait a little longer. After enduring the frustration of often leading but hitting mechanical problems in 1994, Bernds luck changed and everything came together a year on. In the AMG Mercedes the German regularly blitzed the opposition, taking 11 wins from 23 starts to claim both the DTM and ITC titles. Nobody could have deserved his success more, and he rightly became the key driver in the Stuttgart giants racing programme. The final year of the ITC in 1996 yielded only four wins, but his consistent finishes brought him second in the final standings behind Manuel Reuters Opel. With the high-tech formula scrapped, Mercedes unleashed their CLK-GTR on the FIA GT series and Bernd shared in six wins from the eleven races to emerge as clear drivers champion. Despite five wins from ten starts, the German had to settle for second place behind AMG team-mates Ludwig and Zonta in 1998. 
Since Mercedes concentrated solely on Le Mans for 1999, Bernd was without a regular racing schedule, but with the revised German Super Touring series in place for 2000 he will surely relish the chance to fight for the championship with the stunning new V8-engined CLK.";

Switching to the Joest Porsche team, he drove immaculately to win the 1985 Le Mans 24 Hours (with Ludwig and Winter) and the 1986 Mount Fuji 1000 Km (with Ghinzani). However, Paolo still yearned for success in single-seaters and spent two largely unproductive seasons in F3000 switching from team to team in search of a winning formula.

A poor start and a string of DNQs were to some extent overcome by switching teams to GA Motorsport in mid-season, though it was 1988 before he tasted success with a superb win at Vallelunga. But then came a worrying number of incidents, culminating in the Johnny Herbert crash at Brands Hatch, when Gregors Lola was launched into a terrifying series of barrel-rolls from which he was fortunate to escape with no more than a fractured wrist. 
Moving into Grands Prix in 1989, he spent a fruitless time trying in vain to qualify the EuroBrun, and decided to quit while ahead when the rear wing fell off on his debut for Rial. Foitek took his money to Brabham at the start of 1990 and at least made a couple starts, but then he moved to the Onyx team, which was on the way to oblivion as a Swiss gentleman by the name of Monteverdi took control. All in all, it was a sorry mess and before long Foitek had disappeared from view.";

A favourite for the title the following year, his chances were ruined by a disastrous early-season run, and only when he switched to the Cellnet Intersport team did things improve and Martin return to the winners circle. 
He remained in F3 for a third year in 1988, but in mid-season he jumped ship, much to Intersports chagrin, to join Eddie Jordans Q8 F3000 team. In just four races, the Ulsterman took two wins and two second places. Things seemed set fair for a championship challenge in 1989. but after a win at Vallelunga had been wiped out he lost the initiative to new team-mate Jean Alesi, despite a victory at Brands Hatch. 
Meanwhile Donnelly had made a steady GP debut for Arrows, and signed to drive for Lotus in 1990. The car was not one of the best, but Martin impressed nevertheless, until disaster struck in practice for the Spanish GP. He was very fortunate to survive when his car disintegrated after impact with the barriers, the helpless driver being tossed onto the track still strapped to the seat and the remnants of the car, and only first-class medical help at trackside saved his life. 
Donnellys rehabilitation was long and painful, but he was to make a miraculous recovery, although, sadly, it would not allow a return to the Grand Prix arena. 
In 1992 he set up a Vauxhall Junior team and Martin Donnelly Racing has since been very successful in the junior single-seater formulae, helping guide and shape the careers of a new generation of young chargers with their sights set on Formula 1.";

Bruno came through Formula Italia to contest the 1976 BP Formula 3 championship in a March, and he did very well to run a close second to Rupert Keegan in his first season in the category. Benefiting from the close attentions of Robin Herd and the March factory, Giacomelli graduated to Formula 2 in 1977 and took three wins, but suffered through poor reliability. Enjoying substantial backing, he made his Grand Prix debut in a third works McLaren in selected races, but at this point he was still focusing on Formula 2. In 1978 he blitzed the opposition, winning eight of the 12 rounds in the works March to become the first Italian ever to win the title. 
In 1979, Bruno joined the Alfa Romeo team for what was to be very much a learning year. The gloves were off in 1980 and at first he floundered, prone to silly errors which undid much good work. Then, after Depaillers death in a mid-season testing accident, he found himself leading the team, and rose to the challenge magnificently. 
Maybe he lacked motivation, for while there were occasions during the next three seasons when his undoubted ability shone, too often he seemed uninterested and at odds with his machinery. Out of a Grand Prix drive from 1984, Giacomelli surfaced occasionally in Indy Car and sports car racing over the next few seasons to no great effect, so it was a considerable surprise when he was brought into the Life team in 1990 to replace the disenchanted Gary Brabham. The exercise was something of a joke, however, as Bruno rarely seemed to venture beyond the pit lane. 
In 1995 Giacomelli was keeping his hand in racing a Porsche in the Monza four-hour race, and after two seasons away from the tracks he garnered enough sponsorship in 1998 to contest the highly competitive Porsche Supercup series, where he performed more than respectably on occasion.";

Palmers racing career took a back seat while he qualified as a doctor, but early races with a van Diemen in 1979 and 1980 brought him a drive with Dick Bennetts crack Formula 3 team for 1981. In a superb year, Jonathan took seven pole positions and eight wins and set ten fastest laps to win the Marlboro F3 championship by a large margin from his rivals. A move into Formula 2 with the Ralt team brought him back down to earth with a jolt as they struggled to find a competitive set-up, but it was a different story in 1983 when, with the full attention of Honda, Jonathan and his team-mate Mike Thackwell dominated proceedings, Palmer winning six of the 12 rounds (five of them in a row at the end of the season) with a display of brilliant driving backed by much planning and hard work behind the scenes. 
After a drive for Williams in the 1983 European GP, Palmer found himself first with the RAM team, then the ambitious but overstretched Zakspeed outfit, struggling even to gain sight of a top-six finish. Luckily he kept his competitive edge sharpened in sports cars; driving a Richard Lloyd Porsche, he won at Brands Hatch in 1984 with Jan Lammers and finished second at Le Mans in 1985, and in 1987 he won the Norisring race with Baldi in Bruns Porsche. 
By now Palmer was at the start of a three-year association with Tyrrell. The first two years, spent struggling with a Cosworth against the turbo brigade, found him picking up the crumbs, but some excellent drives brought hard-earned points for the team and Jonathan won the Jim Clark Trophy for top non-turbo driver in 1987. A competitive new chassis allowed Palmer to take a splendid fifth at Imola in 1989, but his form sagged after the arrival of Jean Alesi, who stole the show. The seasons finale saw a despondent Jonathan fail to qualify, and his Grand Prix career was over. 
In 1990 he acted as a test driver for McLaren-Honda and returned to competition in sports cars with a Porsche 962, but after the sudden death of James Hunt the personable and ever-talkative Palmer moved into a commentary role for BBC TV. 
Jonathan has recently set up his own ultra-professional junior single-seater series, Formula Palmer Audi. At a realistic cost the identically prepared cars offer up-and-coming young drivers the chance to show their skills as they seek to make their way in the sport.";
155;"Christian Danner";6;4.4.1958;"Мюнхен";"Бавария";"земля";;"Кристиан Даннер";"";"";"Christian got involved in motor sport by racing (and regularly crashing) a Renault 5 in Germany, and soon came to the attention of Manfred Cassani, who was looking for a young driver to promote. Danner was given a BMW M1 to race in the German G4 championship and a couple of Procar GP support races, and did so well in these that BMW signed him on a three-year contract to race in the works March F2 team. With no single-seater experience, Christian struggled in 1981 - his first season -and he was usually overshadowed by the teams lead drivers, Boutsen, Corrado Fabi, Cecotto and Gabbiani, but by the end of 1983 he was not far off the pace, as witnessed by his pole position at the Nurburgring. 
Unfortunately for Christian, BMW then pulled the plug on their F2 programme and at first he was left without a drive for 1984, eventually joining the Bob Sparshott team. That season was dominated by the Ralt-Hondas, but Danner was up there with the rest, and with a minimal budget he tackled the inaugural F3000 season in 1985 with the same team. This was to be the breakthrough year for Christian. Not the quickest driver but certainly the most consistent, he became the formulas first champion. This brought him a Grand Prix chance at Zakspeed, and then a contract with Osella for 1986, which was bought out in mid-season when Arrows needed a replacement for the badly injured Marc Surer. 
Christian rejoined Zakspeed in 1987 and, paired with Martin Brundle, performed quite well given the equipment available. He was on the sidelines in 1988, but could have had the dubious privilege of a EuroBrun drive from mid-season had he not been too tall to fit into the car. The following season saw his final shot at F1, driving the Rial for Gunther Schmid. He scored a distant fourth at Phoenix, but finally quit as the team slid into oblivion. 
Christian then spent the next few years as a real globetrotter, competing in Japanese F3000, Indy cars and the GTCC, driving a BMW in 1991. Landing a works-backed Alfa in the DTM/ITC run by Schubel, Danner put in some very strong performances, and was rewarded with outright wins in 1995 at Helsinki and Norisring. 
Christian is a co-owner with Andreas Leberle of the Project Indy CART team, which has always competed on very limited resources. Danner managed to drive in a couple of Indy Car races himself in 1995, the first of which, in Miami, brought the team a remarkable seventh place, despite his having to resort to an elderly 93 Lola. It is a testament to his racing abilities that, in 1997, even two years away from CART proved to be no barrier to Christian. At short notice, he hopped into the Payton/Coyne Lola at Detroit and picked up the teams first point of the year with a solid 12th-place finish. 
Lack of finance has since kept Project Indys plans on the back burner and therefore his racing activities have been centred on the German Super Touring series with an Alfa Romeo. Looking to the future, however, the charismatic Danner is exploring the possibilities of starting up a low-tech touring car series in Germany.";
156;"Eddie  Cheever";24;10.1.1958;"Финикс";"Аризона";"штат";"Eddie McKay Cheever Jr.";"Эдди Чивер";"";"";"Eddie Cheever has enjoyed such a long innings in motor racing that it is perhaps easy to forget the startling impact he made on Formula 3 in 1975 when barely 18 years old, or the fact that two years later he had raced successfully for the Project Four team in Formula 2 (taking a superb win at Rouen in 1977) and the BMW Junior touring car team with their 320i in the German national series. The world was his oyster, or so it seemed, especially when a satisfactory test for Ferrari saw him lined up for a works F1 drive in 1978. But the best-laid plans dont always work out, and when Gilles Villeneuve was signed Eddie could see his chances of a regular ride were slim and backed away from the deal. 
Cheever had his first stab at Grands Prix in 1978 when, after failing to qualify the hapless Theodore for the first two races, he switched to the Hesketh team, which at least enabled him to make the grid but had little else to recommend it. Then it was back to Formula 2 for the rest of the year and a series of morale-sapping incidents which seriously undermined his reputation, despite second-place finishes at Rouen and Enna. 
Now no longer quite the hot property of just 12 months earlier, Eddie threw in his lot with Osella for another season of Formula 2 in 1979, and was to enjoy a happy year with the little Italian outfit, taking three wins (Silverstone, Pau and Zandvoort). When the team took the bold decision to enter Grand Prix racing the following year, naturally Cheever went with them. To say it was a character-building season would be an understatement, and Cheever certainly found out about life at the back of the grid. There was a little success to savour, however, for he joined the Lancia sports car team, winning a round of the World Championship of Makes at Mugello with Patrese, and taking second places at Brands Hatch and Watkins Glen with Alboreto. 
A move to Tyrrell in 1981 found his career moving in the right direction, the American picking up points on no fewer than five occasions before being tempted to the Ligier team for 1982, where, when he managed to finish, it was usually in the points, including a second place at Detroit. Eddie was chosen to partner Alain Prost at Renault in 1983, a season which was to be his big opportunity to make the jump into the very front rank of driver talent. Although there were flashes of brilliance, he could not sustain them, and while he performed more than respectably, especially in qualifying, his performances were always judged against Prosts - a no-win situation. In the event, a switch to the Benetton Alfa team meant two seasons of disappointment and mechanical unreliability, but never did he ease his forceful driving style, or pay much attention to the subtle art of fuel economy. If the turbo engine lasted, all well and good; if not, then it was going out in a big way - and it usually did. 
Out in the cold in 1986, save for a race for Lola at Detroit in place of the indisposed Tambay, Eddie drove the TWR Jaguar in endurance racing, winning at Silverstone and finishing well elsewhere, but the lure of Formula 1 was still great and he joined Arrows for three seasons during which his incredible enthusiasm sustained him through the frustrations of usually being no more than a midfield runner. There were occasional gems, such as his drives into third place at Monza in 1988 and Phoenix in 1989, where he hounded Patrese to the finish. But the down side was his increasing irritation with the team, which manifested itself on the track, particularly at Spa, where he was reprimanded for obstructive driving tactics. 
Seeing no future in hanging on in Formula 1, Cheever joined the Indy Car trail in 1990, where in truth his form was something of a disappointment considering the abundant skill he possessed. A chance to build a solid platform for success with Chip Ganassis team came and went, despite a second place at Phoenix and a fourth at Indianapolis in 1992. Subsequently Eddie teamed up with A J Foyt in a combustible partnership which came close to a win at Nazareth in 1995 but, predictably perhaps, failed to last out the season. 
The ever-uncompromising Eddie then set his sights on the IRL with a win in the Indy 500 as his ultimate goal. After finishing 11th with John Menards car in 1996, he decided to form his own team in 1997 and had the immediate bonus of a lucky win in the season opener at Wait Disney World. Mission was accomplished in 1998 when, starting from an unpromising 17th on the grid, Eddie sped to a superbly judged Indy 500 win. Driving beautifully, he led 76 of the 200 laps and even survived a collision with a back-marker. 
Cheever has since been a mainstay of the IRL, but is apparently now setting his sights on NASCAR, planning to take in a few races in 2000 with a view to running his own team in the future.";

Winning the Shell Volant award set him on his way in Formule Renault, but Rene switched to Elf in 1974 when an opportunity arose to race their Formula 2 car, taking fourth place at Nogaro on his debut. In 1975 he competed in Formule Super Renault, winning the championship, before undertaking a full season of Formula 2 with an Elf-backed works Martini-Renault. 
He was the fastest man around and came agonisingly close to taking the championship, scoring three wins (at Pau, Enna and Estoril) and six fastest laps but eventually lost out to Jabouille. Resolved to iron out the errors which had cost him so dear in 1976, Arnoux was back the following season and again won three races (at Silverstone, Pau and Nogaro), deservedly taking the coveted title. 
The little Martini team, which had enjoyed enviable success in the junior formulae for many years, ambitiously moved into Formula 1 for 1978 and Arnoux was naturally entrusted with their neat Cosworth-powered car, but the underfinanced project was doomed from the start, leaving the GP novice to scratch around for drives from mid-season. He did a couple of races for Surtees, who would dearly have loved to have got his hands on him earlier, for after running a string of second-raters here at last he could see gold. However, Rene was destined for greater things, joining Renault for 1979. 
Teamed with his old rival Jabouille, the still shy newcomer began to assert himself from mid-season onwards, and looked a serious championship prospect at the start of 1980. Consecutive wins in Brazil and South Africa proved sadly illusory, but the game little Frenchman never gave up the struggle although his car repeatedly let him down. 
Unfortunately for Arnoux, his nemesis in the shape of Alain Prost joined the team for 1981, immediately pushing the unhappy incumbent to the margins. He bounced back in 1982 to something like his best, all but matching Prosts speed, but not his measured performances. When he won the French GP in defiance of team orders it seemed that a split was inevitable, and sure enough he moved to Ferrari for 1983. Driving in typically forceful style, Arnoux mounted a serious championship bid on the back of three mid-season wins, but eventually fell just short. 
In 1984 his performances became increasingly inconsistent and, despite an absolutely brilliant drive at Dallas, there were times when he seemed totally uninterested. It was a situation that could not last and early in 1985 an amicable separation was agreed. Joining Ligier for 1986, Arnoux showed brief flashes of his old form in the Renault-powered car but, when he voiced criticism in the press of the Alfa engine the team had arranged to use the following season, the Italian concern immediately terminated the project. The team was then obliged to adapt their new design to accept the Megatron engine, and suffered the inevitable consequences. Things got even worse in 1988 with the totally disastrous JS31, which was perhaps one of the most evil-handling machines of recent times. 
Although no longer a contender, Arnoux blithely drove on as if he were, but by now the summit of his ambitions was a desperate search for the championship point or two that would keep his team out of the pre-qualifying trap. His ever-increasing lack of track manners and general cussedness caused mounting consternation among his fellow drivers, and by the time he retired at the end of 1989 the halcyon days of the early eighties were all but forgotten. 
The Frenchman finally made a return to the track in 1994, finishing 12th at Le Mans in a Dodge Viper. He was back in 1995 with a Ferrari 333SP, but much of his time has been spent acting as a driver coach and adviser to wealthy Brazilian hopeful Pedro Diniz in his attempt to carve out a top-flight Grand Prix career, and acting as a Grand Prix summariser on Italian TV.";

It was all a long way from the start of his career when, after his 1970 debut in Italian Formula Ford, he began the slow climb up the motor racing ladder through Formula Italia to Formula 3 in 1973. His early days in Italian F3 were underfinanced, but he did finish second to Riccardo Patrese in 1976. Moving up to the European series in 1977, Piercarlo did extremely well to take the title, his phlegmatic approach being vital in a team that was beset by upheaval. The next step into Formula 2 with a March was a big disappointment, and this appeared to be a major blow to his aspirations. 
Salvation was nigh. In 1981 he was called in as a last-minute replacement for Osella after Giorgio Francias credentials failed to satisfy FISA, and he qualified for the Belgian GP. This was the start of what was to be a long association with the little team, his best result being a much-needed fifth place at Dallas in 1984. He did take a brief sabbatical in mid-1985 when a second Toleman was entered, but returned to the fold for 1986. In Grands Prix, results were understandably hard to find, but he had been successful in endurance events, winning the Fuji 1000 Km in a Porsche with Barilla. 
In 1987, Ghinzani tried his luck in a Ligier team suddenly shorn of potential when an Alfa Romeo engine deal foundered as the season dawned, and then it was on to an equally fruitless sojourn at Zakspeed, before just one more season back in the Osella camp. 
Ghinzani certainly had staying power; he started 96 Grands Prix, but more pointedly failed to qualify for another 31 - a real glutton for punishment!

Promoted into the ORECA F3000 team for 1986, Raphanel soon found his feet and ended the season looking a good bet for honours in 1987, but somehow he failed to spark thereafter, enduring two lacklustre seasons. At the end of 1988 he stood in for his former team-mate Dalmas at Larrousse, but gearbox problems stymied his chances of qualifying.
Signing to race for Coloni in 1989, he found himself among the early-risers attempting to pre-qualify, and did extremely well to get on the grid at Monaco. A mid-season move to Rial merely meant that he could turn up a little later for practice, but he was still to find his Sundays free.

The following year he concentrated on winning the French F3 championship in his Martini, and took fourth in the European series, joining the two-car AGS Formula 2 team for 1982. Streiffs season was up and down, due in part to the arguments that raged over the technical regulations, but he finished the year strongly to take sixth place in the final standings. 
In 1983, AGS and Streiff really got to work, despite the teams chronic shortage of funds, and the Frenchman carried the fight to the dominant Ralts, though he had to wait until the very end of the 1984 season before scoring a long overdue and well earned win. He did, however, have the fillip of a Grand Prix outing for Renault in the 1984 Portuguese GP. His F3000 campaign with AGS in 1985 was well funded yet strewn with mechanical failures, but by now he had been elevated to the Grand Prix ranks, taking over the Ligier of de Cesaris in mid-season and scoring a fine third place in the end-of-year Australian GP. With Ligier missing the South African GP because of the political situation, Philippe drove for Tyrrell, and he joined the Ockham team full time in 1986 to handle their Renault-engined cars. He drove well enough on occasions during the next two seasons, but was generally outpaced by his team-mates Brundle and Palmer, the latter claiming the non-turbo honours after a switch to Cosworth power in 1987. 
Streiff was taking a gamble when he joined the tiny AGS GP team for 1988, but at least it was an environment with which the Frenchman was familiar, and early in the season he caught the eye with some spirited performances, most notably at Imola, where he qualified and raced superbly, only for engine problems to intervene. Philippe was looking forward to another season with the team in 1989, but in a pre-season test at Rio he crashed heavily, sustaining serious back injuries which, possibly due to a lack of prompt medical assistance, resulted in him being left totally paralysed.";

Unfortunately his aspirations were soon blunted by an unhappy Formula 2 liaison with Minardi, which left him out in the cold as far as single-seaters were concerned. Poppy then began a long and rewarding association with Walter Brun, racing the Swiss entrants Group C Porsche sports cars through to the early nineties, the high spot being a win at Jerez in 1986. 
However, Bruns over-ambitious move into Formula 1 was a different story which found Poppy struggling to qualify uncompetitive machinery. He subsequently embarked on a busy racing career based in Italy, where he drove a Jolly Club Ferrari 348 in the GT Supercar championship in 1993 and 94. At the end of that season he took a Ferrari F40 to victory in the final round of the All-Japan GT championship, and success continued in 1995 when he shared the victorious Porsche 962 K8 at the Daytona 24 Hours.

A graduate of Formule Renault, Schlesser got bogged down in French Formula 3 and production racing before turning to the European F3 championship in 1981. However, his Martini was saddled with the wrong brand of tyres and the undoubted high spot of the year was a terrific second place at Le Mans, sharing a Rondeau with Jacky Haran and Philippe Streiff. Still determined to succeed in single-seaters, Jean-Louis joined the Maurer F2 team alongside Bellof in 1982, but it was another season of frustration, as he did not enjoy the best of equipment.
In 1983 Schlesser began work as a test driver for Williams, and attempted to qualify the RAM for the French GP. He then returned to production cars, winning the French championship in 1985, before Tom Walkinshaw signed him for the TWR Jaguar sports car team in 1986. Disappointingly, finishes were thin on the ground and he was released, ultimately joining the Kouros Sauber team, which, in 1988, became the official representative of the Mercedes factory.
Schlesser scored two wins and finished second to Martin Brundle in the points standings that year, and the following season he made no mistake, winning five rounds (Suzuka, Jarama, the Nurburgring, Donington and Mexico City) to claim the World Sports Car Championship, a feat he repeated in 1990, when he shared the title with Mauro Baldi.

Back in F2, he surprised many in 1984 with his speed in a March-BMW, winning at Hockenheim in mid-season only to depart from his team abruptly due to financial differences. 
His plans for a Formula 5000 drive in 1985 fell through, and he had to settle for a single race at the end of the year before arranging a full season with a minimal budget in 1986. A winning start at Silverstone, followed by a second at Vallelunga, gave him an early-season lead which he was unable to maintain, Pascal finishing seventh in the championship table. 
Prompted no doubt by his past links with the team, AGS chose Fabre to drive their F1 challenger in 1987. The car was slow, but he flogged away, usually bringing it to the finish, until he lost his ride to Roberto Moreno, who lost little time in scoring the teams first championship point.

The European karting champion of 1975, Teo began his rise to prominence with fourth place in the 1978 European F3 championship, followed by a trip down-under to win the New Zealand Formula Pacific series. This set up a season in Formula 2 for 1979 with a semi-works March, but Fabi took a while to find his feet and finished a disappointed tenth in the final standings. 
With the backing of Robin Herd, who rated him very highly, Teo led the works March Formula 2 effort in 1980. The season was dominated by the Toleman pair of Henton and Warwick, but Fabi was third, and seemed certain to join the March F1 team for 1981 until the drive went to Derek Daly at the eleventh hour. Instead Teo opted for a season in Can-Am with the Paul Newman teams March 817 and won four races, but the more consistent Geoff Brabham took the title. 
In 1982 the Toleman team gave Teo a Grand Prix opportunity that he was soon to regret taking. The year was a disaster and Fabis stock in Europe was low, but help was at hand and, with Herds backing, Teo got himself a ride in Indy cars for 1983. He put the Forsythe March on pole for the Indy 500 - only his second outing for the team - and led the race. He went on to score four wins that season and was undisputed Rookie of the Year. Teo then took on a punishing schedule for 1984, accepting an offer to continue in Indy cars while racing in F1 for Brabham whenever commitments allowed, and in the end he gave up the Indy ride to concentrate full-time on F1. Rejoining Toleman for 1985, he earned pole position at the Nurburgring, which indicated the cars potential, but reliability was elusive. After the take-over by Benetton, Fabi stayed on, and the 1986 BMW-powered car proved very fast, Teo taking two pole positions, but he was overshadowed by his team-mate Berger and then, in 1987, by Boutsen. 
Realising his chances of finding a top seat in F1 were slim, Fabi opted for a return to Indy cars in 1988 with the ambitious Porsche project but this was to prove fraught with many problems over its three-year span and yielded but a single win, in 1989. Teo then successfully turned to endurance racing with TWR Jaguar, winning the 1991 drivers championship, mainly by dint of his consistent finishes. 
He had to be content with a place in the Toyota team at Le Mans the following year, but set up yet another return to Indy cars for 1993, although his tenure with the Pennzoil Hall/VDS team was to prove largely undistinguished. The 1995 season saw a real return to form, however, as Teo joined forces once more with Jerry Forsythe and Robin Herd. Often a front-runner, the little Italian was distinctly unlucky not to pick up a win, but his performances were not deemed sufficient for him to retain his seat and he was passed over in favour of Indy Lights sensation Greg Moore. 
Teo made a brief return to CART action in 1996, substituting for the injured Mark Blundell with PacWest. His races at Long Beach and Nazareth were as low key as the Italian himself, who then slipped quietly away from the racing scene.";

172;"Jacques Laffite";10;21.11.1943;"Париж";"Париж (Иль-де-Франс)";"департамент";"Jacques-Henri Laffite";"Жак Лаффит";"";"";"The smiling countenance of Jacques Laffite brightened the Grand Prix scene for more than a decade, during which he was a consistent performer who really excelled only when his car was absolutely on the pace - but then he simply flew. 
His introduction to the sport was as a mechanic to Jean-Pierre Jabouille during his 1968 F3 season. Jacques resolved to race himself and started in Formula France before hitting the French F3 trail in the early seventies. In 1973 he won the French F3 championship in his Martini, and came close to taking the British John Player title as well, his splendid season including big wins in the prestigious Monaco and Pau GPs. With backing from BP France, Laffite moved into Formula 2 in 1974 with a March-BMW, soon establishing himself among the front-runners and winning a round at the Salzburgring. Having tried a number of drivers during the first half of the season, Frank Williams decided on Jacques for the German GP, and although his race ended in a shunt he had impressed more than the previous incumbents and settled in for the next season and a half. In 1975 Williams were very much in the doldrums, but Laffite profited from others misfortune to provide the team with a much-needed second place in Germany. In Formula 2 meanwhile, racing an Elf-backed Martini, Jacques clocked up six victories, edging out Jabouille to secure the European title, and he also took the Kauhsen/Autodelta Alfa T33 to victory at Dijon, Monza and the Nurburgring. 
Ousting the originally nominated driver, Jean-Pierre Beltoise, Laffite joined Guy Ligiers debutant Ligier-Matra team for 1976 and quickly became a favourite son at Vichy, working hard to bring the car to a competitive pitch. He was rewarded with a win at Anderstorp in 1977, but it soon became clear that Cosworth power was a necessity for sustained success. At the beginning of 1979, now partnered by Depailler, Jacques flashed to victory in the opening two Grands Prix, but the dominance could not be sustained, as development brought more questions than answers. He took another win at Hockenheim the following season, but plans were already afoot to return to Matra power in 1981 under the Talbot banner. The team enjoyed a remarkably consistent season, and a strong run saw Laffite take two wins and make a late bid for the title before finishing fourth just behind Piquet, Reutemann and Jones. The promise evaporated in 1982, however, and Jacques managed only two points-scoring finishes all year, prompting his return to Williams on a two-year deal to drive alongside Keke Rosberg. 
His year began soundly, but the Cosworth car became less and less competitive and Laffite suffered the late-season embarrassment of non-qualification at Monza and Brands Hatch. Things picked up in 1984, but with Rosberg extracting the very maximum from the car, the Frenchmans efforts seemed pedestrian by comparison. 
Despite rumours of retirement, Jacques returned to Ligier and rediscovered some of his form of old, enough at least to ensure that his beaming smile appeared on the rostrum from time to time. Perhaps spurred by the arrival of Arnoux, Laffite produced some sparkling displays in 1986, even leading the Detroit race briefly. Then came a multiple shunt at the start at Brands Hatch which left the unlucky Jacques trapped in his car with both legs broken. His Grand Prix career was over. 
Jacques was to return to the circuits, enjoying the cut and thrust of the French touring car series over the ensuing seasons. In 1995 he was still a regular in the Supertourisme series driving an Opel Vectra, but now races mainly for fun in selected events. He also made a welcome return to the Grand Prix paddock working for Ligier in a PR capacity.";

Winning his third-ever F3 race, de Angelis snatched the championship at the very last gasp from Piercarlo Ghinzani, and took an impressive seventh in the European series. After taking a controversial win in the 1978 Monaco F3 race, Elio moved up to Formula 2 but he endured a fairly barren year and, since he was not slow to show his feelings, was seen as something of a spoilt prima donna.
It may have been a considerable gamble, but at the age of just 20 the inexperienced de Angelis joined a Shadow team which was in steep decline. With the exuberance of youth and not a little skill, the young Roman extracted the very best from a poor car and his performances were not lost on Colin Chapman, who signed him for 1980. He made a great start for Lotus, taking a brilliant second place in Brazil, and - one or two silly incidents apart - soon settled down to become a most consistent points finisher over the next couple of seasons, the highlight of which was a hair's-breadth win over Keke Rosberg in the 1982 Austrian GP.
The following year was a transitional period for the team as they struggled to gain reliability from their Renault turbo-engined car, and results were thin on the ground. It was the reverse in 1984, though, as a string of excellent placings saw Elio leading the World Championship by mid-season, but in the end he had to settle for third place in the points table behind Lauda and Prost.
De Angelis had spent four seasons vying somewhat inconclusively for number one status with Nigel Mansell, but the arrival of Ayrton Senna in 1985 soon put the Roman in the shade, a lucky win at Imola following Prost's disqualification notwithstanding. Accepting the situation would not change in his favour, Elio joined Brabham in 1986 to race their radical but complicated 'lowline' BT55, but he managed just one finish, and that after losing a wheel, before a routine testing session at Paul Ricard in mid-May ended in catastrophe when the Brabham was thought to have suffered a component failure, crashing heavily at 180 mph. Elio's injuries were so severe he stood no chance of survival, dying in hospital a few hours later, and the entire motor racing world mourned the loss of a popular driver who had long since earned the respect of his peers.";

More formally known as the Earl of Dumfries, Johnny was determined to make it in his own right as a racing driver, and showed some promise and not a little speed when taken under the wing of Dave Morgan to race in Formula 3 in 1983. He landed a plum drive in the BP-backed Dave Price Racing team for 1984, and the season exceeded even his wildest expectations, Johnny winning the Marlboro F3 championship at home and nearly repeating the feat in the European series, achieving a magnificent total of 15 wins. His stock was justifiably high, and for 1985 he joined Onyx for a season in F3000, but a bright start soon faded and by mid-season he was out of work. 
Luckily for Johnny, help was at hand in the form of Ayrton Senna, who declined to accept Derek Warwick as his new team-mate at Lotus, as he was entitled to under the terms of his contract. This gave Dumfries his big chance, but while he let no one down he was naturally very much the number two to Senna in all things. He did, however, score three points and handled himself pretty well. Politics of one sort had helped him into the team, and unfortunately the revolving door took him straight back out when an engine deal with Honda meant Satoru Nakajima would be Sennas partner in 1987. Johnny did some testing for Benetton and then went into endurance racing, with drives in both Porsches and Toyotas, but the unquestioned highlight was his win at Le Mans (with Lammers and Wallace) in 1988 in the TWR Jaguar.";
175;"Patrick Tambay";10;25.6.1949;"Париж";"Париж (Иль-де-Франс)";"департамент";;"Патрик Тамбэ";"";"";"Easy-going and impeccably mannered, the general consensus is that Patrick was just too nice a guy to succeed in the cut-throat world of Grand Prix racing. Certainly the cosmopolitan Frenchman had a lot of talent, but maybe he lacked the single-minded determination which is a crucial part of any true champions armoury. 
Patricks career got off to the brightest of starts when he won the Pilote Elf scheme, which was the passport to Formule Renault in 1973. Finishing runner-up in the series, he leap-frogged straight into the European F2 championship with the Elf team for 1974 and won a round at Nogaro to cap a consistent first season at this level. A seat in the Elf-backed works March team the following year should have brought Tambay more success than a singleton victory. Although he scored four second places to take the runner-up position in the series, Worryingly he was involved in a series of silly accidents. Competing in the series with Elf backing for a third year in 1976 but this time running a Martini chassis, he once again scored just a single victory - remarkably, like his two previous wins, it came at Nogaro - but finishing third in the championship was regarded as a failure by the French oil company, who dropped him in favour of Didier Pironi. 
Tambays career was in limbo at the start of 1977 until he was offered the Carl Haas/Jim Hall Can-Am car in place of the badly injured Brian Redman. Though the opposition was in the main modest, he made the most of the opportunity and won six of the seven rounds in which he competed to take the championship easily. His luck had turned for the better for, after a fiasco at Dijon where he was dumped into a Surtees at short notice in a desperate attempt to get him into the race, he finally made his Grand Prix debut in Teddy Yips Ensign at Silverstone. Given the previous poor reliability record of the N177, the inexperienced Tambay did well to score points in three races, and even a massive practice crash at Monza failed to dent the Frenchmans new-found confidence. 
Joining the McLaren team in 1978 should have seen Patrick make the big breakthrough, but unfortunately their star was temporarily on the wane, and although he took five points-scoring finishes that year his second season was something of a disaster. Failing to qualify at both Zolder and Monaco was the nadir of a year in which McLaren plumbed the depths. So in 1980 he was back across the pond, making hay in Can-Am once more and taking a second title in the Carl Haas Lola T530. 
Teddy Yip still had faith in the Frenchman and signed him for his Theodore F1 outfit for 1981. A sixth place in the US GP first time out was way beyond the little teams expectations, but Patrick performed so well in the car subsequently that he was an obvious candidate to replace Jean-Pierre Jabouille when he decided to retire from Ligier in mid-season. However, Tambays short stay with the French team was a desperately unhappy one, ending in a string of accidents which could have beached his Grand Prix career for good. 
In motor racing one mans misfortune is anothers opportunity, however, and in the saddest of circumstances Patrick was brought into the Ferrari line-up in place of the late Gilles Villeneuve. He soon found his feet and after yet another dreadful setback for the team at Hockenheim, when Pironi was injured so terribly in practice, he rose to the occasion magnificently by winning the race. For the rest of the season he carried the weight of the team manfully despite a painful back problem which caused him to miss two races. Tambay was joined by Rene Arnoux for 1983, and the two Frenchmen had the equipment to launch a championship assault. Although Arnoux came closer in terms of results, Patricks all-round performances were the more convincing, and it was a major surprise when he was the one released at the end of the year to make way for Alboreto. 
Moving to Renault for the 1984 season, Tambay failed to find any sort of continuity as minor problems constantly undermined his efforts. This led to an inconsistency which was scarcely helped by the introduction of the disappointing RE60 in 1985. Patrick made a solid start but the car could never be persuaded to offer a truly satisfactory level of performance on a regular basis, which must have driven both Tambay and Warwick to distraction as they gave their all. At the end of the year the Renault factory team closed their doors to lick their wounds, leaving Tambay seeking employment once more. He found it with the Haas Lola team, who were embarking on a full season with the Ford turbo engine. As an exercise in wasting money, this was as good as any, and both Tambay and Alan Jones were forced to spend the season in midfield mediocrity before the team folded. 
Subsequently Patrick joined the TWR Jaguar team for the 1989 season, gaining some good placings with Jan Lammers. He has since worked in Grand Prix racing once more, both as a TV commentator and, briefly during 1994, in a PR role with the now defunct Larrousse team.";

The following year he made the move into Formula 2, gathering valuable experience. He had also been signed by Jochen Neerpasch to race a BMW 320i in the up-to-2-litre division of the German touring car championship for BMWs Junior Team, but his season was somewhat overshadowed by a clash with Hans Heyer which saw him suspended for two months. 
Despite this unfortunate incident, Marc was promoted to the BMW Team Polifac Formula 2 squad for 1978, as number two to Bruno Giacomelli, who went on to dominate proceedings. However, Surer backed his team-mate superbly, taking a clear second place in the championship with six second-place finishes. In 1979 he was promoted to team leader and duly took the honours, but serious doubts over his pedigree were already being voiced, as he seemed unable to stamp his authority on races in the manner of true champions. 
Nevertheless Marc had already been given his Grand Prix baptism by Ensign, and he signed to drive for ATS in 1980, but his season had barely begun when he crashed in practice for the South African GP, sustaining broken ankles, which kept him sidelined until mid-season. For 1981, Surer joined the little Ensign team, and really began to come out of his shell, taking a superb fourth place and fastest lap in Brazil, and sixth at Monaco, before moving to Teddy Yips Theodore set-up. 
In 1982 his progress was once more halted by injury, when a crash at Kyalami left him with leg injuries which delayed his Arrows debut. Fit again, he was somewhat overshadowed by the emerging Boutsen and his chances to shine were restricted by the late development of the turbo car in 1984. When Francois Hesnault quit the Brabham team early in 1985, Marc finally got the opportunity to show his ability, and he enjoyed his best-ever season as team-mate to Nelson Piquet. In 1986 the tough Swiss was back with Arrows but, taking part in a German rally, he crashed his Ford into a tree; his co-driver was killed and Surer sustained serious injuries and burns which ended his competitive racing career. 
Since then he has kept close links with the sport on a number of fronts. Not only has Marc acted as a commentator for Swiss TV and headed up the competitions department at BMW, looking after their drivers, but he was also able to enjoy following the excellent progress of his wife Yolanda as she proved to be a formidable competitor in the German Super Touring series.";

His subsequent exuberant performances, stabbing the turbo-powered Williams around the worlds circuits with frightening commitment, did much to supply the entertainment factor which was often missing from the sport. 
Born in Sweden of Finnish parentage, Keijo Rosberg was three times his countrys karting champion before moving with equal success into the rough-and-tumble world of Formula Vee and Super Vee, taking the Castrol GTX title in the latter category in 1975. He found a seat in the Toj Formula 2 team in 1976, but apart from a fourth place at Rouen this was not a successful alliance. By the end of the year Keke had linked up with Fred Opert, who satisfied the Finns insatiable appetite for racing in 1977 by running him first in New Zealand, where he took the Stuyvesant title, and then in the European Formula 2 championship and the Labatts Atlantic series in North America. 
There was no let-up the following year when Rosberg undertook a mind-numbing schedule which totalled some forty races. In addition to repeating the previous seasons marathon stint for Opert, Keke moved into Formula 1 and scored a shock win in a rain-drenched International Trophy race for the new Theodore team. Although this result was something of a fluke, there was no doubting the Finns stunning car control, and his name was noted down as one to watch by Formula 1 team managers. In World Championship races, of course, it was a different story, as he struggled to make an impression in three different makes of car. 
Resigned to a season of Can-Am in 1979, Rosberg was often quicker but, tellingly, also more erratic than champion Jacky Ickx, but a route back into Grand Prix racing was to re-open after James Hunts sudden retirement. His half-season in a difficult car failed to provide any satisfactory results, but he was back in the frame to stay. When Wolf amalgamated with Fittipaldi for 1980 Keke was part of the package, and on his maiden outing at Buenos Aires he scored his first championship points. However, the team lacked the technical and financial resources to make a real impact and Rosberg was forced to make up the numbers until the end of 1981 when it closed its doors. 
The cards suddenly began to fall for the Finn when he took over the Williams seat vacated by Alan Jones at the start of 1982. Within two races the teams other star driver, Carlos Reutemann, had also walked away from Grand Prix racing and suddenly Keke was leading the team. Showing incredible maturity for one not familiar with racing at the sharp end of the grid, Rosberg made the odd mistake but maximised every potential points-scoring opportunity and took a splendidly thought-out win in the Swiss GP at Dijon. By the end of the year he had overhauled the unfortunate Didier Pironis points total and claimed a fairytale World Championship triumph. The following year saw Keke hampered by a lack of turbo power, but this didnt prevent him taking a classic win, driving on slicks throughout, on a damp track at Monaco. He took the Cosworth car into battle with great ferocity elsewhere, never admitting defeat when many others would have been content merely to cruise round. When he finally got a turbo engine himself, Keke was to be frustrated by the poor handling of the Williams chassis, but nevertheless he scored perhaps the best win of his career in searing heat in Dallas in 1984 when most of his rivals failed to avoid a meeting with the concrete walls. Rosbergs relationship with Williams was never completely harmonious and he wanted away at the end of the season but, forced to see out his contract, he got on with the job without further complaint. Initially at least, he was unhappy with the arrival of Nigel Mansell for 1985 but soon established a rapport with his new team-mate. Having agreed a lucrative deal with McLaren, Rosberg signed off from Williams with a sparkling win in Adelaide to start the final short chapter of his Grand Prix career, but the partnership was to be something of disappointment for both sides, with Keke rather taken aback by his inability to come to terms with the talents of Alain Prost. 
Rosberg quit without regrets, but stayed closely involved with the sport, making a return to the wheel in the World Sports Car Championship with Peugeot in 1991. With Dalmas, he took wins at both Magny Cours and Mexico, before switching to the German touring car championship the following year to race a Mercedes. Apart from his role in guiding young Finnish talent (the careers of both Mika Hakkinen and JJ Lehto are under his shrewd managership), Keke has formed his own DTM/ITC team, running works-backed Opels and led by the experienced Klaus Ludwig. In 1995 he announced another retirement but it wouldnt be a massive surprise if we saw him behind the wheel again in selected events in the future.";

Endowed with immense physical strength and bucket loads of bravery, he became perhaps the ground-effect eras most skilled practitioner with a driving style that appeared brutal at times, but certainly brought results. 
The son of Stan Jones, a famous fifties Australian racer, young Alan left school to work in his fathers Holden dealership, racing a Mini and then an old Cooper before coming to England in 1967 only to find that even a Formula Ford drive was out of his reach. Undaunted, he was back in 1970 with fellow racing aspirant Brian McGuire and the Aussie pair set about running a couple of F3 Brabhams financed by buying and selling second-hand cars. Money was tight, with Alan and his wife Beverley living a hand-to-mouth existence to pay for the racing programme, but by 1973 Jones had a foot on the ladder to the top with a DART-entered GRD, taking second place in the John Player championship. Then came a setback as the team folded, leaving Alan with no drive for 1974 until one Harry Stiller came to the rescue. He ran the Australian in Formula Atlantic, and then at the end of the year Jones made a big impression in a one-off F5000 drive for John MacDonald. 
Alan stepped up to Formula 1 in 1975 with Stillers Hesketh, but the team managed only three Grands Prix before its owner packed his bags and went abroad for tax reasons, leaving Alan high and dry. Graham Hill then invited him to join the Embassy team in place of the injured Rolf Stommelen, and he brought the car into fifth place at the Nurburgring before the German was fit to resume. Fortunately, MacDonald found Jones a seat in his RAM F5000 car while he continued to look for a Formula 1 ride. After a sensational drive to second place in the 1976 Race of Champions at the wheel of a Surtees Alan was placed under contract for the season, but relations soon became strained between team boss and driver, with Jones more interested in his US F5000 programme with Theodore, which brought wins at Mosport and Watkins Glen. He ended the F1 season with fourth place at Mount Fuji, but without the prospect of a Grand Prix ride after a complete breakdown of communications with Surtees. 
Then in 1977 tragedy worked in his favour. When Tom Pryce was killed in South Africa Alan took over the vacant seat at Shadow and seized the opportunity brilliantly, winning in Austria and scoring points finishes with some aggressive drives. Frank Williams, rebuilding his team in the wake of the Walter Wolf fiasco, saw Jones as just the sort of pragmatic charger he needed for 1978 and, at the wheel of Patrick Heads no-nonsense machine, the Aussie regularly put himself in among the leaders, often dogging the omnipotent Lotus 79s. Eleventh place in the championship was in no way a reflection of the teams competitiveness that year, but Alan had the satisfaction of also making his mark in Can-Am, taking the title in the Haas/Hall Lola T333. 
The following season marked the true blossoming of Alan Jones the racing driver. The new ground-effect Williams FW07 proved that the imitator had leapfrogged the innovator, and in Alans hands the car was simply stunning. A spate of retirements in the first half of the year torpedoed his title hopes, but four wins from five starts gave a fair indication of his late-season dominance. Nothing was left to chance in 1980 as Jones squeezed every ounce of potential from the car. He never once eased up, and certainly look no prisoners, but the title was won with crushing dominance. There was no let-up in 1981 either, as he headed towards self-imposed retirement; he still raced as if that first Grand Prix win had not yet been achieved, finishing on a high note with a lights-to-flag win at Caesars Palace. 
Perhaps the story should have ended there. But after racing Porsches back in Australia, and despite a broken leg sustained in a riding accident, Jones was tempted back in 1983. In his all-too-brief spell with Arrows, he took third in the Race of Champions, and then raced at Long Beach, before pulling out when he was unable to agree a contract. 
The terms offered by Haas Lola proved sufficiently tempting to bring him back to the Grand Prix arena late in 1985. Both technically and administratively, the project was something of a fiasco, leaving Alan to pick his way through the 1986 season with no more than occasional glimpses of his racing past. Wisely there were no further attempts to extend his Grand Prix career, Jones preferring to keep his hand in down-under in touring cars. 
In 1995 he was still winning occasional races in a Holden Commodore, and as the profile of this form of racing in Australia rose enormously Alan found major sponsorship from Marlboro. He formed his own team in 1996, running Ford Falcons, but by mid-season he had lost this substantial backing and took the decision to race only in selected events thereafter.";

Graduating to Formula 2 in 1979 with a Chevron, he looked a little rough round the edges, but the following season, equipped with a Toleman, he improved immensely and scored an excellent win at Zolder. 
At this point Rothengatter harboured hopes of a Formula 1 ride, but in the event he missed the first half of 1981 completely before making a brief return to Formula 2, and it was not until 1984 that he finally realised his ambition with the Spirit team, now shorn of Honda power. Halfway through the following season he joined Osella in place of Ghinzani, who had moved to Toleman, and he then had a year with Zakspeed. 
Huub had basically just been making up the numbers, but he remained remarkably cheerful nevertheless, clearly enjoying his bit part on the Grand Prix stage. He later successfully managed the budding career of fellow countryman Jos Verstappen.";
180;"Allen Berg";23;1.8.1961;"Калгари";"Альберта";"провинция";"Allen Bernard Berg";"Аллен Берг";"";"";"A stocky little Canadian driver, Berg emerged from the 1982 North American Formula Atlantic series by way of the winter Pacific championship (which he won for New Zealand ex-racer Graeme Lawrence in a Ralt) to contest the 1983 British F3 championship. With no experience of F3 cars or, naturally, the circuits, he did a good job in this formative season, especially after switching to the Eddie Jordan Racing team. This was the year in which the Senna-Brundle axis dominated proceedings, but Alien was regularly leading the rest in pursuit of the star duo. 
Staying with EJR, hopes for success in 1984 were high, but a season of mishaps and frustrations saw him finish second in the standings to Johnny Dumfries. This left Bergs career in something of a vacuum, and it was a surprise when he scraped together sufficient finance to take over the unwieldy Osella in mid-1986 after Christian Danner had moved over to Arrows. This was a year without the pressures of having to qualify, so Alien was at least able get some experience and racing mileage under his belt. 
Berg subsequently tried his hand at the German touring car championship with his own car in 1991, but in subsequent seasons he found a happy hunting ground down Mexico way. He was Formula 2 champion in 1993 and took third place overall in the well-funded 1995 Formula 3 series.";

He was quite content to enjoy his racing in sports-prototypes and touring cars, happy to be part of the Grand Prix scene while it wanted him. 
He started racing in the Scirocco Cup in 1976, but soon began a long and happy association with BMW which saw him rapidly progress through their junior team from saloons to Formula 2. He was to spend three seasons in the formula, coming close to victory at Hockenheim in 1981, when his troubled Ralt was overhauled almost within sight of the finish. 
An abortive drive for Arrows apart, Manfreds Grand Prix career began with the ATS team at the start of 1982. There were those who thought his style harsh and crude, but there was no doubting either his commitment or bravery as he manhandled the cars for all they were worth. Unfortunately, as the statistics show, his Formula 1 efforts were largely frustrated by a catalogue of retirements and he was no doubt glad to be able to go racing properly in the Kremer Porsche - particularly in 1985, when the season had started so brightly with a second place at Mugello and then a win at Monza, with Marc Surer. 
Tragedy was to strike at Mosport, however, when in an unexplained accident Manfreds Porsche left the track at high speed. The driver was finally freed from the wreckage, and taken to hospital critically injured. Though no bones were broken, his head injuries were severe, and he died some 24 hours later.";
182;"Niki Lauda";22;22.2.1949;"Вена";"Вена";"земля";"Andreas Nikolaus Lauda";"Ники Лауда";"";"";"There are some who try to buck the system but usually fail, and others who play the game and manipulate it to their own ends. Niki Lauda managed to do both, with the adroitness of his off-track political and business manoeuvrings being matched only by that of his driving and racecraft, which saw him win three world titles. 
After a couple of seasons in which he struggled to make an impression in Formula 3 and sports cars, with a Porsche 908, Lauda took a bank loan to finance a season of Formula 2 in a semi-works March and a one-off drive in his home GP in 1971. Although his results were hardly inspiring there were fleeting glimpses of his talent. Already the quiet self-confidence was there, as was the inner determination to overcome every setback, and he effectively mortgaged himself to the hilt to buy a seat in the works March team alongside Ronnie Peterson for 1972. To say the F1 season was disastrous is almost an understatement, and the dreadful 721X proved absolutely hopeless. Fortunately the F2 March 722 was competitive, at least allowing Niki to compete with his peers. His win in the spring John Player F2 race at Oulton Park was one indication of his potential, his ability to closely match Petersons testing times another, but March discarded him right at the end of the year, and he virtually saved his career by joining BRM for 1973 in a pay-as-you-race deal which he knew it would be difficult to honour. 
When Lauda managed to overshadow his team-mates in the early races, took his first championship points at Zolder and held third place in the Monaco GP, he was able to put his contract problems behind him, but only by locking himself into a three-year deal. There were a few successful touring car races for BMW which proved quite lucrative, but most important was the fact that he had been targeted by Ferrari for 1974. Contract or not, there was no way Louis Stanley was going to stop Niki heading for Maranello, and the young Austrian wriggled his way out of the deal. Displaying typical pragmatism, he set about his new task at Ferrari with a huge programme of testing and constant development which paid immediate dividends. There were a couple of wins and four second places, but a mid-season dip in form cost him his title chance. 
For a driver in his first year with a front-line team he had performed admirably, but Lauda was privately convinced that in 1975 the title would be his, and once the transverse-gearbox car was introduced there was no stopping him. Nine pole positions and five Grand Prix wins (complemented by victory in the International Trophy) saw the Austrian sweep to his first championship, and 1976 showed every sign of going the same way until the fiery crash at the Nurburgring which so nearly took his life. Though badly burned around the head, Niki returned to defend his title just weeks later and the fact that he ultimately failed to retain his crown was largely irrelevant, despite the dreadful treatment the Italian press meted out to him after his decision to pull out of the Japanese GP. Even at Ferrari there were doubters who thought he had lost his bottle, however, and Reutemann was brought into the team, much to Laudas annoyance. 
Inwardly Niki must have relished the challenge, and with a perfect blend of aggression and circumspection he all but humiliated his new team-mate the following season to prove to the hierarchy that he was still the boss. A second title was duly won and, with a characteristic lack of sentiment, Lauda then announced that he was moving to Brabham. His two years with the team brought only limited success, Niki winning the Swedish GP in the notorious fan car and the Italian GP in 1978, and the non-title Dino Ferrari Trophy at Imola the following season. At Montreal that year, he tried the new Cosworth BT49 in practice and made the shock decision to retire then and there. 
He stayed away for two years, during which he built up his airline business, before being tempted back in 1982. Perhaps it was his ego, the money, or maybe just the challenge of proving the inevitable doubters wrong. One thing was for sure: once he had demonstrated to himself that the speed was still there, he wasnt going to mess around. There was a job to be done in developing John Barnards innovative McLaren MP4 and Niki was just the man to do it. True, there were occasional lapses and lacklustre performances in the Cosworth car, but once his attention turned to the TAG turbo-powered machine at the end of 1983 Lauda was fully focused. He needed to be for 1984, when he was joined by Alain Prost. Using all his experience, the wily Lauda hung on to the Frenchmans tail and eventually took his third World Championship by the narrowest of margins after a fabulous year. His final season perhaps went according to expectation, as the still hungry Prost forced the pace, while Niki was happy to adopt a more tactical approach. Unfortunately the season was blighted by unreliability, but at Zandvoort we saw Lauda the racer one last time, as he kept his number one McLaren in front of Prosts sister-car in a Formula 3-style battle to the finish. 
This time Niki stayed retired, but in 1992 he was invited to act as a consultant to Ferrari as they attempted to recapture the glory days which had been gone for so many years. It has been a long and sometimes painful process of reconstruction for Maranello, with Michael Schumacher seen as the final piece of the jigsaw.

A move to Brabham in 1985 proved a big let-down, with a shaken Hesnault leaving the team after being lucky to escape injury in a massive testing accident at Paul Ricard.

After finding his feet in 1978, Baldi was soon making his mark, finishing fourth in the 1979 European championship and third in the Italian series. 
Victory in the Monaco F3 race in 1980 by the huge margin of 47 seconds was the platform from which Mauro began his domination of the formula. Armed with a March for the 1981 season, he trounced the opposition, recording eight wins and four second places in the 15-race European series. 
By-passing Formula 2, he secured a drive with Arrows for 1982 and did well enough in a difficult car, but when the opportunity arose to rejoin his former boss Paolo Pavanello in the reconstructed Alfa Romeo team Mauro switched camps. However, the year disintegrated after political frictions had prompted the mid-season departure of designer Gerard Ducarouge. Unable to continue with the team for 1984 as a result of sponsor Benettons preference for Patrese and Cheever, Mauro was left with no alternative but to race for the underfinanced Spirit outfit. 
Meanwhile Baldi had taken the opportunity to race sports cars for Martini Lancia, winning at Spa in 1985, and he quickly became one of prototype racings most successful exponents, forging his reputation with privateer Porsches before becoming a key member of the Sauber-Mercedes and Peugeot factory teams. Despite the recent decline of sports car racing, Baldi has remained active. In 1994 his major triumph came at Le Mans, where he shared the winning Porsche 962LM with Haywood and Dalmas. Mauro also reappeared in single-seater competition, driving for Dale Coyne in an Indy Car race at Mid-Ohio. 
In 1995 he was part of the Ferrari 333SP sports car attack in IMSA, taking fourth place at Sebring with Alboreto and van de Poele, but he suffered three indifferent seasons before enjoying welcome success with Gianpiero Morettis Ferrari in 1998, when he shared in victories at Daytona, Sebring and Watkins Glen. 
In 1999 Baldi joined Jean-Pierre Jabouilles team to race in the World Sports Car Cup, taking a win at Spa, a second place at Monza and a third at Barcelona. He also drove for Dyson Racing in the States, sharing the second-placed Ferrari 333SP with Didier Theys at Road Atlanta.";

But because his successes in Grand Prix racing were not concentrated into one great spell, his long and in the main very successful career, which spanned more than twenty years, tends to be overlooked. 
In fact he started racing way back in 1963-64 in his native Northern Ireland with an Austin Healey Sprite, before graduating to single-seaters. Outstanding in Irish Formula Libre, he soon crossed the water to try his hand against sterner opposition. In 1970 he took his Brabham BT30 into the European F2 championship, but a heavy crash at Rouen left him with a broken arm and leg. Undaunted, he was back the following year and, competing as a privateer in his elderly car, put to shame many more vaunted names. His persistence was about to bring rewards, for in 1972 a sixth place in the John Player Trophy race at Brands Hatch in a March 721, plus some excellent drives in Alan McCalls F2 Tui, caught the eye of both Brabham and Gulf, who were to give the then bearded Ulsterman his first real breaks. The luck of the Irish certainly deserted him when, in the Race of Champions early in 1973, he broke his leg once more after the throttle stuck open on the new Brabham BT42. With typical quiet determination he was back to make his Grand Prix debut at Silverstone, and by the end of the year he had set up a full F1 season with Hexagon Racings private Brabham. A great drive to sixth place at Monaco was followed by some terrific performances once he had the use of the BT44 chassis, headed by a brilliant drive into fourth in Austria after a pit stop. 
Sadly the team were unable to continue in 1975, and Watson, having previously driven in a few Formula 2 races for Surtees, joined Big Johns outfit. A second place in the Race of Champions and fourth in the International Trophy were as good as it was going to get in a year fraught with mechanical difficulties. Just before the end of the season Surtees withdrew to regroup his efforts, leaving Wattie unemployed. Fortunately he soon picked up a ride in the Penske team at Watkins Glen and, after taking ninth place with a car not set up for the track, he was offered a contract for the 1976 season. The team were to suffer something of an up-and-down year, but Johns magnificent victory in Austria gave him the confidence that comes from being a winner. The only thing he lost that day was his famous beard, as a result of a wager with Roger Penske! 
When Penske decided to call it a day at the end of the year, Bernie Ecclestone lost no time in signing John to join Carlos Pace in his Brabham-Alfa team for 1977. Tragically, the Brazilian was soon killed in an air crash, leaving Watson to carry the burden of development in an unproven car. He nearly won at Paul Ricard until fuel pick-up problems took away his last-lap lead. The season ended up as a major disappointment after beginning with so much promise, but things improved in 1978, when at least he was a regular points scorer, although teamed with Niki Lauda his performances seemed a trifle erratic. When James Hunt became disillusioned with McLaren, Watson was the man chosen to take his place. Initially it seemed to be a disastrous move, for the team were at a low ebb under the declining Teddy Mayer regime. The following season was frustrating, with points scraped here and there in a difficult car, and 1980 was to bring even less cheer, Watson being out-driven in the early part of the year by newcomer Alain Prost. Some observers were tempted to write him off but John fought back, and his confidence and speed began to return - particularly when he was installed in the John Barnard-designed MP4 under McLarens new Ron Dennis regime in 1981. He scored a lucky win at Silverstone when Arnouxs Renault faltered, and generally reestablished his standing as one of the leading drivers which had seemed under threat. 
Joined by Niki Lauda in 1982, Watson answered the Austrians Long Beach challenge with a well-taken win at Zolder, but overall his season was hampered by unpredictable lapses in form which led to some lacklustre showings. In 1983 he came through the field to take an unexpected win at Long Beach, but was generally handicapped by the lack of turbo power until late in the season. He fully expected to remain paired with Lauda for a third year in 1984, but protracted negotiations worked against him when Alain Prost came onto the scene after being released by Renault. With no other options open, Wattie was left to find a seat in sports car racing, driving occasionally for Rothmans Porsche over the next couple of years and taking a win at Fuji in 1984 with Bellof. A last-minute call-up by McLaren to deputise for the injured Lauda in the European GP merely emphasised how two seasons out can take away the edge, and there was to be no more Formula 1. 
Instead he returned to endurance racing with the Silk Cut Jaguar team and later with Toyota, before retiring from the track to concentrate on his Silverstone-based Performance Driving School and his role as a commentator, firstly for the satellite channel Eurosport and currently for the BBC, covering the British touring car championship.";

Soon outgrowing domestic competition, he made a dramatic European debut, scoring a 250/350 cc double, and went on to take the 350 cc title in his first season, becoming the youngest-ever World Champion. More bike successes followed - at 20 he was the youngest winner of the famous Daytona 200 - but a crash early in 1977 put him out of contention for the season. He came back to win the F750 title in 1978, but as Kenny Roberts star rose, Cecottos appetite for bike racing waned. 
He made an inconclusive F2 debut in 1980, taking part in just three races, but finally abandoned his bike career at the beginning of 1981. After a torrid first half of the season with Martini, Johnny changed teams and under the guiding influence of Markus Hotz knuckled down to the job, swiftly becoming a top-six regular and scoring points in the last four races of the season. A hoped-for Grand Prix opportunity for 1982 failed to materialise so Johnny remained in F2 with a works March. He lost the championship to his team-mate, Corrado Fabi, after the pair had finished the season level on points and Cecotto was forced to drop his worst score from his total. Nevertheless he had made the transition from two wheels to four brilliantly, and this time there was a seat for him in Formula 1. 
His first Grand Prix season in the Theodore produced little save a welcome sixth place at Long Beach, so Cecotto moved to Toleman to partner F1 newcomer Ayrton Senna in 1984. He spent the first half of the season somewhat in the Brazilians shadow, until a very heavy crash in practice for the British Grand Prix left him hospitalised with serious leg and ankle injuries. It was to be the end of his Formula 1 ambitions. 
Upon recovery he forged a successful new career in the flourishing touring car scene. Driving for BMW, he won the 1989 Italian championship, and quickly became one of the Munich concerns favoured sons.

Mikes car was hors de combat and the race restarted without him. So theres the conundrum: technically, did he start or not? In the event, it was to be nearly four years before another Grand Prix chance came his way, and by that time his career had lost momentum - and the driver, perhaps, the necessary determination. 
Mikes early career was meteoric. In 1979, aged just 18, he contested the Vandervell F3 series in a works March, finishing third in the championship with five wins. In 1980 he raced the ICI March 802, putting in some brilliant drives without gaining the reward he deserved, turned down the chance to race the works Ensign, practised an Arrows at Zandvoort, and then joined the Tyrrell team for Montreal. 
A hot favourite for the Formula 2 title in 1981, Thackwell started the season with a win at Silverstone, but a heavy crash at Thruxton left him on crutches and his title hopes evaporated. Ron Tauranac, unconvinced about Mikes fitness, dropped him from the F2 team just before the start of the 1982 season, and his confused driver was left in the lurch, eventually scraping a deal together which saw him living from race to race. Fortunately the New Zealander was back in the Ralt fold for 1983, though a slowish start meant he had to play second fiddle to team-mate and champion-elect Palmer. However, 1984 was to be his year and, showing a new resolve, he dominated proceedings, winning seven of the 11 rounds, taking six poles and nine fastest laps, and leading an incredible 408 of the 580 laps run. 
Still without a Formula 1 ride, and eyeing Indy Car racing, Thackwell moved somewhat unwillingly into F3000 with Ralt in 1985. Having proved beyond doubt that he was the best driver in the series but failed to clinch the title through sheer bad luck, he understandably felt dissatisfied with his lot and refused to commit himself to a full season in 1986. When he did compete, notably at Pau, he showed what talent was being wasted, 
subsequently running around - albeit quite successfully - in endurance racing with Sauber and Brun before a brief reunion with Ralt in F3000 in 1988. Disillusioned, he then walked away from the sport before the age of 30.";
192;"Chico Serra";2;3.2.1957;"Сан-Паулу";"Сан-Паулу";"штат";"Francisco ""Chico"" Serra";"Чико Серра";"";"";"A contemporary and bitter rival of fellow countryman Nelson Piquet, Serra enjoyed an outstanding Formula Ford season in 1977, winning the Townsend Thoresen FF1600 championship, before stepping into Formula 5 with the Ron Dennis-run Project Four March. It was a strong year, with Piquet and Warwick among the opposition, but Chico was unflustered, escaping a huge accident at Mallory Park to finish third in the Vandervell series and joint second with Warwick in the BP championship. 
Back in Formula 3 in 1979, Serra made no mistake, winning the 20-round Vandervell championship, taking five victories and seven second places, and putting his Project Four March on the front row no fewer than 16 times. Moving into Formula 2 along with the team, Chico found the going tough, being very much the number two driver to Andrea de Cesaris. 
Joining Emerson Fittipaldi to race his fading teams cars in Grands Prix, Serra again struggled, but when he managed to get the car onto the grid he more often than not brought it home to the finish, gaining his only championship point at Zolder in 1982. After the team closed its doors, Serra briefly raced the Arrows while Alan Jones prevaricated over the prospect of a GP comeback with the team, before losing out to Thierry Boutsen. 
A dispirited Serra returned to his homeland, no doubt ruefully watching Piquets latest successes. He didnt turn his back on the sport, however, and continues to race saloons to this day in his native Brazil.";

Without any financial help, Danny somehow clung on in various junior formulae, scoring the occasional success, only to be knocked back by some misfortune. Eventually he went back to the States to get his career moving again, making a good impression in Can-Am with an old Lola in 1980, and returned the following year, winning a race at Las Vegas and taking fourth in the championship. Suddenly the momentum was building; an Indy Car debut for Forsythe-Newman at Atlanta brought third place, and after he had been bumped from the team by Rebaque and his bank balance Danny returned to Can-Am to finish third in the standings. 
For 1983 he took the plunge into Formula 1 with Tyrrell, a fifth place at Monaco and second in the Race of Champions showing what he could do, but the lure of a more competitive drive in Indy cars took Danny back across the Atlantic. In Shiersons team he took three wins in 1984, before joining Roger Penskes crack team to win a famous victory at Indy in 1985 which made him a household name in the US. Subsequently he went on to win the Indy Car title in 1988, with four wins and eight pole positions, before joining the ultimately unsuccessful Patrick Racing Alfa Romeo effort. He then moved to the Galles team with substantial backing from Molson, taking his total of wins to 17 by the end of the 1993 season. 
Danny was out of an Indy Car drive at the start of 1994, but he did quite well in a couple of guest outings for Alfa Romeo in the DTM on tour rounds at Donington and Mugello. He also took third place at Le Mans in a Dauer Porsche with Boutsen and Stuck, before the chance came to resurrect his Indy Car career with the fledgling PacWest team. His experience was invaluable as he tested the car late in the year, and he was taken on for a full-time ride in 1995. Apart from a bright performance in the opening round at Miami, the season was largely unrewarding and was cut short when he suffered a nasty crash at Michigan which left him suffering a broken pelvis. 
Happily he made a full recovery, but there was no realistic prospect of his making another return to Indy Car competition. Taking up a TV commentary role, Sullivan continued to make selected appearances in sports car events, posting an eighth place at Le Mans in 1998 in the Team Bigazzi McLaren F1 GTR with Piquet and Cecotto.";
194;"Eliseo Salazar";37;4.11.1954;"Сантьяго";"Сантьяго";"область";"Eliseo Salazar Valenzuela";"Элизеу Салазар";"";"";"A virtual unknown when he came to Britain in 1979 to contest the Vandervell F3 championship, Salazar made a good impression with some gritty performances, despite being saddled with the initially temperamental ground-effect Ralt RT5 while his rivals ran more proven machinery. For 1980 the Chilean switched to the Aurora British F1 series with the RAM Racing Williams FW07 and won three races (including the once prestigious International Trophy), but finished second to his team-mate, Emilio de Villota, in the championship. 
With much-needed financial backing available, Salazar joined the revamped March team the following season but soon became disillusioned and took his cash to Ensign, where he put in some excellent performances, finishing in sixth place at Zandvoort. For 1982, Eliseo joined the autocratic Gunther Schmids ATS team but, apart from a fifth place at Imola, he was largely in the shadow of Manfred Winkelhock. However, he was involved in a much-publicised incident at Hockenheim after being involved in a collision with Nelson Piquet, when he was assaulted by the irate Brazilian. 
His options now limited if he wished to stay in Formula 1, Salazar went back to RAM for 1983 but, perhaps predictably, things rapidly disintegrated, and after a string of non-qualifications he found himself out of a drive. 
The Chilean then spent many years racing in sports cars and, after a good 1994 season in IMSA, found the backing to join Dick Simons Indy Car team for 1995. Salazar did surprisingly well in this highly competitive series, appearing particularly comfortable on the ovals. Fourth place in the Indianapolis 500 was the years high point and the veteran stayed with Simon in 1996 as he moved to the rival Indy Racing League. 
Since then Salazars grit and determination have certainly been tested, the Chilean returning on three separate occasions from huge accidents in which he suffered broken limbs. He has one IRL victory, at Las Vegas in 1997, to his credit and has continued a parallel career in sports car racing, in a Ferrari 333SP and latterly a Riley & Scott.";
195;"Roberto Guerrero";31;16.11.1958;"Медельин";"Антиокия";"департамент";;"Роберто Герреро";"";"";"This personable Colombian driver could have made a good career for himself in Formula 1 had he not chosen to move into Indy Car racing at the end of 1983 when no suitable F1 drive was available, for, on his speedy passage to the top, Roberto had already displayed genuine talent. Joint second in the British F3 series in the unfashionable Argo, and an immediate winner at Thruxton in his first Formula 2 season, Guerreros fine performances caught the eye of Mo Nunn, who gave him the Ensign drive for 1982. Roberto did extremely well in difficult circumstances, as he did in his second season following the teams merger with Theodore. 
So it was off to the States, and stardom, Guerrero finishing second in the 1984 Indy 500, and winning two races in 1987, at Phoenix and Mid-Ohio, before a crash while testing at Indy left him in a coma for 17 days. He made a full recovery but his career never quite regained its earlier momentum, and he became bogged down in the largely disappointing Alfa Romeo Indy programme until he joined Kenny Bernsteins team in mid-1991. Roberto took pole at Indy in 1992 but crashed on the warm-up lap and spent the rest of the campaign on the sidelines. He then signed with Bernstein for a full season in 1993, but after a generally lacklustre year he lost his ride with three races remaining. 
No longer capable of getting a full-time drive, Roberto joined forces with Pagan Racing in 1994 and did well to scrape into the Indy 500 as 33rd and final qualifier with a two-year-old Lola-Buick. Unfortunately Guerrero, now a US citizen, was posted as first retirement again when he spun into the wall. He remained with the little team for 1995, targeting the Brickyard once more (though he raced at Phoenix as a shakedown for the month of May), and this time things went much better. He finished a creditable 12th, having lost time under caution early on. 
When the Indy Racing League was formed in 1996 it must have come as manna from heaven to the likes of Guerrero. Not only did it give him a racing lifeline, but it also represented a tantalising opportunity to have his image engraved on the magnificent Borg Warner Trophy, something that he came agonisingly close to achieving back in 1987 when, after a totally dominant performance, the race was snatched from his grasp by Al Unser Snr when clutch problems at a pit stop slowed him near the finish. 
Roberto has been a regular competitor in this much-maligned series but, thus far, victory in the Indy 500 still eludes him.";
196;"Raul Boesel";2;4.12.1957;"Куритиба";"Парана";"штат";"Raul de Mesquita Boesel";"Рауль Бойзель";"";"";"After karting and saloon car success, Boesel followed the well-trodden path of Brazilian hopefuls bound for Europe with the aim of becoming the next Fittipaldi. 
Never having driven a single-seater and with no English, Raul sensibly bought himself a drive with Van Diemen. Quickly learning from team-mates Moreno and Byrne, he finished runner-up in both Formula Ford championships in 1980, winning eight races. Opting for F3 for 1981, Boesel enjoyed a remarkably consistent season, finishing in the points in 16 of the 20 rounds and winning three of them to take third place in the Marlboro championship. 
Well funded after his success, Raul took his sponsorship money into F1 with the RAM March team but it was to be a disastrous season. Things were not much better the following year, his F1 career effectively torpedoed as he struggled in a Ligier team then in decline. 
Deciding to change course, he headed off to the States and found a ride with Dick Simons Indy Car team in 1985 and 86. Just missing out on a couple of good seats for 1987, Boesel found himself a berth in the TWR Jaguar sports car team and enjoyed a highly successful season, the Brazilian winning the drivers sports car title to raise his stature immensely. 
Returning to Indy cars, Raul made little impression until 1993, when he enjoyed an excellent season with Simon. He posed a consistent threat to the elite, and was distinctly unlucky not to notch up a win. Unfortunately he was not so competitive the following year, and a beautiful partnership ended in litigation as the Brazilian took his Duracell sponsorship to Rahal-Hogan. His new team, running a Lola-Mercedes combination, struggled, however, and it was often Boesels car which hit problems. 
For 1996, Raul opted to join forces with Barry Greens team - the reigning champions - with hopes high for an upturn in his fortunes. Sadly for the Brazilian, only fleeting glimpses of competitiveness were seen in a season plagued with engine and electrical maladies and he took his substantial Brahma beer sponsorship to Patrick Racing for 1998. A late switch to Reynard chassis at the start of the season put the team on the pace and Raul posted some convincing performances, peaking with a pole position at Gateway. Unfortunately the second half of the year saw a slump in the teams fortunes and Boesel was left without a CART ride at seasons end. 
The Brazilian decided to switch to the Indy Racing League for 1998, and the past two seasons have brought only modest success. He briefly returned to the CART ranks in 1999 with Team KOOL Green at Miami (substituting for Paul Tracy), and with All American Racers at Chicago (where he scored a single point) and Laguna Seca. Raul also enjoyed a couple of sports car appearances in the DAMS Panoz, sharing third place at Mid Ohio (with Bernard) and fifth at Watkins Glen (with Bernard and Wallace).";
197;"Jean Pierre Jarier";10;10.7.1946;"Шарантон (близ Парижа)";"Валь-де-Марн (Иль-де-Франс)";"департамент";"Jean-Pierre Jacques Paul Jarier";"Жан-Пьер Жарье";"";"";"Jarier had his few fleeting moments in Grand Prix racing when nobody could live with him, but this inconsistent Frenchman ultimately flattered to deceive and the once bright promise soon faded.
After impressing in saloons and Formula France, Jean-Pierre graduated to the highly competitive French F3 series, finishing third in the championship in 1970 with a Tecno before making an assault on the European Formula 2 championship in 1971. He took the Shell Arnold teams March to a couple of third-place finishes at Albi and Vallelunga, and had his first taste of Grand Prix racing when the team hired the ex-Hubert Hahne March 701 for the Italian GP, bringing the car home in a steady 12th place.
Unfortunately his career took a step backwards the following year when the Shell Arnold team ran out of funds just after Jarier had taken third place at Monza in the Lottery GP. The wealthy Jose Dolhem took over the ride, so it was back to the harum-scarum world of Formula 5, but then came his big break. Signed to lead the March Formula 2 team, Jean-Pierre also found himself promoted to Formula 1 after Chris Amon was sensationally dismissed before the start of the 1973 season. In Grands Prix he was not surprisingly a little overwhelmed but was nevertheless unlucky not to score the occasional point here and there, but in Formula 2 it was a different story as he stormed to the European championship with eight victories in 13 rounds.
Now in demand, Jarier signed for Shadow in 1974 as number two to Peter Revson, but the American was soon tragically killed at Kyalami, leaving the burden of leading the team on the young Frenchmans shoulders. He responded with much courage, taking third place in the International Trophy and then the Monaco GP. He was also a key member of the Matra sports car team that year, sharing the winning car at Spa (with Ickx), the Nurburgring, Watkins Glen, Paul Ricard and Brands Hatch (all with Beltoise).
The following season started sensationally for Jarier. On pole in Argentina, he was unlucky to strip his clutch, and was then leading in Brazil by the proverbial country mile until a metering unit failed. This dominance was not to last, however, and his season disintegrated in a series of spins and crashes while team-mate Tom Pryce was busy asserting himself. Jarier gathered his resources for 1976. In the Brazilian GP, he lay a splendid second and was closing on the leader, Lauda, when he unluckily crashed out on James Hunts oil. Things were never the same after that as the moody Frenchman became increasingly disenchanted with life at Shadow, who dropped him at the end of the season.
He hoped for a drive at Ligier in 1977, but in the event found himself in the ATS team running the Penske. A sixth place on his debut boded well, but the car was never really more than a midfield runner and Jarier failed to score any further points. By the end of the season he was briefly back at Shadow, and then had a one-off outing with Ligier. Meanwhile Alfa Romeo, remembering his superb sports car displays with Matra, had invited Jean-Pierre to drive their T33 cars at Dijon and Paul Ricard, and he won both races with Merzario, while he also raced a Mirage-Renault at Le Mans that year, taking second place with Vern Schuppan.
Jarier was back with ATS in 1978, but achieved little, quitting the team in mid-season. However, his whole career was suddenly revived at the end of the year when he took over the Lotus seat left vacant by the death of Ronnie Peterson. At Watkins Glen he set fastest lap and was in third place until he ran out of fuel near the end, and then in Montreal Jumper put the Lotus on pole and fairly streaked away from the field until a small oil leak in a brake pipe ended his dominance. Ken Tyrrell, looking for a replacement for the Ligier-bound Depailler, gave Jarier the chance to build on his swiftly restored credibility. His two seasons with the team yielded ten points-scoring finishes, but the cars were not world beaters nor did Jarier seem totally involved once he realised there was nothing to aim for.
Early in 1981 he deputised for the still injury-troubled Jabouille at Ligier, before taking the only drive available at Osella. He stayed on for 1982, but apart from a splendid fourth place for the little team at Imola he lost interest badly as the year wore on. He was in the last-chance saloon the following season; he had finally secured a place in the Ligier line-up, but unfortunately the car was not quite the competitive proposition he had dreamed of racing in previous years. On the one occasion a victory was possible, Jarier made a hash of things, running into the back of Rosberg at Long Beach when well placed.
After a decade as a Grand Prix driver, he faced the fact that he was no longer in demand and quietly slipped out of single-seater racing, contenting himself in the French Supertourisme series for many years. In the early nineties Jumper - now somewhat plumper - acquitted himself nobly in the Global GT series: driving a Porsche 911SR, he won rounds at Paul Ricard and Suzuka (with Wollek and Pareja) in 1994, and in 1995 he took second place in a Porsche GTZ at both Jerez and Paul Ricard.
Despite his advancing years, Jarier still has few peers in his class of GT racing. He was French GT champion for the first time in 1998 and, again driving one of his beloved Porsche 911s, repeated the feat in 1999.";

Picturing some of his majestic Grand Prix wins, it seems impossible to believe that here was anything other than a World Champion. Yet there were days when his performance was so lacklustre that you would cringe with embarrassment at his feeble showing. That was the contradiction of this deep-thinking perfectionist who was ultimately unable to summon from within himself the consistency which must underpin any championship success. 
Carlos was a cattle-ranchers son from Santa Fe, Argentina, who began racing in 1965. Competing mainly in saloons such as Ford Torinos, he soon became one of the countrys top talents, gaining some valuable single-seater experience in the 1968 Temporada Formula 2 series. In 1970 he was chosen by the Automovil Club Argentine for a sponsored season in Europe racing a Brabham BT30. The year passed relatively uneventfully, with Carlos learning a great deal and taking the occasional top-six finish. Returning home, he served notice of his talent by taking an aggregate third place in the non-championship Argentine GP in an elderly McLaren M7C. Back in Europe for another season of Formula 2, Reutemann really came good in the latter stages of the year. Although he won only at Hockenheim, there were plenty of brilliant performances and he finished runner-up to Ronnie Peterson in the final standings. 
Having newly acquired the Brabham team, Bernie Ecclestone signed Carlos for 1972 and the Argentinian was to make a sensational GP debut at Buenos Aires, putting the hitherto unloved Brabham BT54 on pole position before finishing seventh. Reutemann then won the non-title Brazilian GP at Interlagos to underline his vast promise, but his momentum was broken soon after his return to Europe when a nasty crash at Thruxton in the F2 Rondel Brabham left him with a crushed ankle. This injury proved troublesome and slow to mend, which knocked his confidence for the rest of that year. 
The 1973 season saw him back in the groove, particularly once the new BT42 was introduced. There were flashes of brilliance and he soon became a regular top-six finisher. With the superb BT44 at his disposal at the start of 1974, Reutemann launched a ferocious opening onslaught, leading the first two Grands Prix before encountering problems, and then winning the third, at Kyalami. But, just as suddenly, his form then vanished before mysteriously reappearing when he won the Austrian GP with a stunning performance. There was another victory at Watkins Glen which prompted thoughts that a World Championship bid was on the cards for the following season, but once again he flattered to deceive. Winning the German GP was the high-point, but he seemed unsettled by the competitive presence of new team-mate Carlos Pace. Things took a turn for the worse in 1976, when Brabham became involved in the Alfa engine project. The powerplant was woefully unreliable, and Reutemann soon became fed up with the situation. He engineered his way out of his contract to join Ferrari, who were anxious to find a replacement for the recently injured Niki Lauda, but in the event Carlos raced only at Monza due to the Austrians amazing recovery. Despite a win in the Brazilian GP at the beginning of 1977, Reutemann was completely overshadowed by Lauda, who with total disdain took great delight in heaping any little humiliation he could upon the Argentinian. 
With the Rats two-fingered departure at the end of the year, Carlos was promoted to lead the Ferrari challenge in 1978, and his form certainly improved, Reutemann taking four wins including a brilliantly judged performance to outwit Lauda at Brands Hatch. Despite this success, he found himself unwanted by Ferrari and joined Lotus in 1979, which was in hindsight the worst possible move. The new Lotus 80 was a technical nightmare and Reutemann stuck resolutely with the 79, with which, to be fair, he put in some brilliant performances which went largely unregarded. Frank Williams still had faith in him and for 1980 Carlos was included in the team alongside Alan Jones. It was a mystery that a driver of such experience should take such a long time to come to terms with his situation; a win at Monaco was achieved by caution and he seemed content to let Jones force the pace as the Australian charged towards his well-deserved championship. The following season saw a far more aggressive Reutemann. He took the FOCA-only South African GP and then embarked on an early-season run of brilliant performances to put himself in a seemingly impregnable position. Then, almost inevitably, came the slump. The title went down to the line at Las Vegas, and Carlos set himself for glory with an utterly brilliant lap to put the car on pole. But once the lights went green Reutemann, his confidence punctured by a mysterious handling problem encountered in the warm-up, just seemed to fade away. A seasons work appeared to be tossed away without so much as a whimper as Nelson Piquet snatched the title by a point. 
Reutemann was back in 1982, but perhaps the roll of the dice at Caesars Palace still weighed heavily on the mind of this introspective and complex man. Just two races into the season, he suddenly retired for reasons that have never really been explained. An enigma to the end.";
207;"Jochen Mass";6;30.9.1946;"Дорфен (близ Мюнхена)";"Бавария";"земля";"Joachim Mass";"Йохен Масс";"";"";"Maybe lacking the killer instinct which separates the winners from the rest, Jochen Mass was nevertheless a very talented racing driver who looked destined for the very top on the evidence of his early career, which began in 1970 with an Alfa saloon before he joined Ford Germany to race their Capri. He really shot to prominence in 1972 by winning the European touring car championship for drivers after major wins at Spa, Zandvoort, Silverstone and Jarama. In addition to a planned F3 programme, he also made his Formula 2 debut in the works March and scored a superb win in the Eifelrennen. 
Retaining his Ford touring car links, Mass signed for the Surtees Formula 2 team in 1973, and won the rounds at Kinnekulle and Hockenheim. He finished a solid second in the championship standings and also earned his Grand Prix debut at Silverstone. Unfortunately his car was wiped out in the Jody Scheckter-instigated multiple shunt, but he was soon back in action, taking seventh place in the German GP. Promoted to the Surtees F1 team full-time in 1974, Jochen enjoyed a useful start to the year with a fourth place in the Medici GP in Brasilia and then second in the International Trophy race. Once the Grand Prix season proper got under way, however, things soon began to go wrong, with a succession of technical maladies afflicting the team. Things reached boiling point when a superb drive in the German GP was ended by engine failure, prompting him to follow Paces example and quit in frustration. Picking up the vacant Yardley McLaren seat for the final two races of the season, Mass was offered a full works ride in place of the retired Denny Hulme for 1975 and emerged as an excellent number two to Fittipaldi, winning the shortened Spanish GP in Barcelona, and impressing mightily at both Paul Ricard and Watkins Glen. 
The Germans subordinate role in the team was to continue during the next two seasons as James Hunt breezed in to highlight the gulf that exists between champions and contenders. Jochen did have his moments, though, and was distinctly unlucky not to win the 1976 German GP, his gamble to run on slicks looking likely to pay off until Laudas accident halted proceedings. He could, however, be relied upon to provide the team with plenty of top-six finishes and was happy to deliver. In 1977 a couple of Formula 2 races for March brought him victories at Hockenheim and the Nurburgring, and he began his long and tremendously successful sports car partnership with Jacky Ickx, winning three rounds of the World Championship of Makes in the Martini Racing Porsche. 
Making the break from an increasingly down-trodden existence at McLaren, he joined the ATS team as number one driver in 1978, but the season was to be desperately disappointing and ended prematurely when Mass suffered a broken knee and thigh in a testing accident at Silverstone. It was to his credit that he made a strong comeback in 1979 with Arrows. Despite being in an outclassed car, he put in some spirited drives, none more stirring than at Monaco where he lay third until brake problems intervened. Continuing with the team for another season, he again proved a consistent performer. Ironically, his best placing was second in the Spanish GP, which was subsequently denied championship status, but he produced another excellent display at Monaco. Out of a drive for 1981, Jochen concentrated on sports car and G5 racing before an unhappy return to the Grand Prix arena with the RAM team in 1982. 
Disillusioned after this final year of F1, Mass turned to sports car racing full-time. With Rothmans Porsche, he took eight wins between 1982 and 1985, before briefly switching to IMSA, and after racing a Brun Porsche in 1987 he joined Sauber, which eventually became the full works Mercedes-Benz team. He remained a very capable driver and his huge experience made him the ideal tutor to the German companys young lions, Schumacher, Wendlinger and Frentzen. Jochen scored three wins in 1988 and added five more in 1989, including a long-awaited and much-deserved victory at Le Mans. In 1990 he won another two rounds but there were no successes the following year, when the programme was running down as Sauber looked towards Formula 1. In 1992 Mass moved into a team management role in the German touring car championship, but continued to enjoy his racing, mainly in GT cars. Throughout the nineties Jochen was a regular in the Grand Prix paddock, where his irreverent sense of humour was a commodity often in short supply.";

Early experience in the harum-scarum world of stock cars led Derek into Formula Ford in his native Ireland. In order to finance his efforts he went to Australia to work in the tin mines with his friend and fellow aspiring racer, David Kennedy, and earned enough to finance his season, winning the 1975 national championship. Then it was across the Irish Sea to try his luck in Formula Ford for 1976. It was a tough year for Daly, who was living out of a converted coach and perpetually strapped for cash, but it was all made worthwhile when he won the Formula Ford Festival at the end of the season. 
Derek stepped up to Formula 3 for 1977 and, driving a Chevron, won the BP championship ahead of Nelson Piquet, while a one-off drive saw him finishing fifth on his Formula 2 debut at Estoril. So impressive was this performance that he got the seat for 1978, and offers also came in for Formula 1. He did a deal with Hesketh and made a sensational debut in the rain at the International Trophy race, leading all the big names until he spun off. Reality soon dawned, however, as he failed to qualify for the first three races and quit in disgust. Luckily Ensign needed a replacement for Ickx and Daly was back, scoring his first point in Canada. He was persuaded to stay on for 1979, but the revamped car was outclassed, and after Monaco Daly returned to his successful ICI Formula 2 ride. This left him available to step into the Tyrrell team, initially in place of the indisposed Jarier. A superb drive at Watkins Glen ended in Daly spinning out, but Tyrrell had seen enough to offer him a drive for 1980. It was again a story of hit and miss, the season yielding a pair of fourth places and a couple of huge shunts. 
For 1981 he was forced to take a step backwards. The RAM March was not competitive, and the atmosphere in the team was tense, but he never gave up. Theodore then threw him a lifeline which put him back on the grid again in 1982, and with Reutemanns sudden decision to retire he found himself catapulted into the Williams team. It was a difficult season for Derek; he supported Rosberg with some classy drives, but found himself dumped at the end of the year. 
Daly then took the decision to turn his back on F1 and try his luck in Indy cars. After a handful of rides in 83, and some promising performances early in 1984, his career was nearly ended by a huge crash at Michigan which badly smashed both his legs. After a long and painful recovery Derek made a tentative comeback to Indy cars late in 1986 and then raced in endurance events for Jaguar and in IMSA for Nissan before announcing his retirement in 1992. 
Derek has since slipped effortlessly into the role of TV commentator on Grand Prix and Indy Car racing on Speedvision, as well as opening a racing school at Las Vegas Motor Speedway in 1996.";

It was when he was working in New Orleans that he gained his nickname. After stepping in for a drummer called Memphis Slim, Borgudd was dubbed ‘Little Slim. Subsequently this was shortened to Slim and it stuck, mainly because his subsequent pay-cheques were made out in this name and he had problems cashing them as his ID card showed his real name, Tommy! 
After a few drives in 1976, Slim returned to the tracks on a more permanent basis the following year, and was soon performing heroics in both the Swedish and European F3 series with an outdated Ralt. Particularly impressive were his efforts in the European championship in 1979 when he finished third overall behind the dazzling Prost and experienced Bleekemolen despite having to miss races due to lack of money as the year wore on. 
A planned season in Formula 2 in 1980 was aborted when the finance was not forthcoming, but Slim occasionally competed in a March in F3 while working on a deal that saw him join the ATS team in Grands Prix for 1981. 
Sixth place - and a championship point - in the British Grand Prix was the high spot in a difficult season. Borgudd then began the next campaign with the Tyrrell team, but his money soon ran out and he was replaced by Brian Henton. That there is more to life than struggling at the back of the grid in Formula 1 has surely been proved by Slim, who went on to carve out a hugely successful, enjoyable - and profitable! - career as truck racing European Champion as well as briefly racing a Mazda Xedos touring car in the Nordic Cup.";

Уайт, Англия";"Pironis ambition to become Frances first-ever World Champion driver was never realised. The crash at Hockenheim in 1982 which destroyed his career and almost cost him his legs would see to that, leaving the cool and unemotional Frenchman to fight the greater battle of learning to walk again, while Alain Prost was enjoying his nations plaudits in 1985. 
Didiers interest in motor racing was awakened by a visit to a meeting with his cousin Jose Dolhem, and as soon as he was old enough he attended the Winfield racing school, winning the prize of an Elf-sponsored Martini for 1973. It was a hard learning year for the young Pironi, who, rather than whingeing, clinically analysed all the ingredients that were lacking in his first season and set about putting them into place for his return in 1974. His attention to detail obviously paid dividends for Pironi became French Formule Renault champion at the wheel of a Martini MK14. 
Moving into Formule Super Renault in 1975 as number two to Rene Arnoux, Didier dutifully supported his team-mate before taking over the number one seat a year later. His dominance was almost total and he ran away with the championship, gaining promotion to the Elf Martini Formula 2 squad in 1977, again as number two to Arnoux. While he was finding his feet in this category, Pironi gambled on dropping into Formula 3 for just one event, the Monaco Formula 3 race. His reasoning was sound, for a win here would be a valuable calling card in his future dealings. Naturally mission was accomplished and he resumed his Formula 2 racing with the air of a man who knew his destiny. Raising his game, by the end of the year he had taken his first win at Estoril, and earned a Grand Prix contract with Tyrrell for the 1978 season. 
As one now expected of this coolest of customers, his first tilt at the big time was accomplished with all the aplomb of a seasoned veteran. Finishing four of his first six races in the points maybe raised expectations a little too high, as he ended the year with a few shunts. However, there was also the considerable kudos of a win at Le Mans in the Elf-backed Alpine-Renault to reinforce his burgeoning reputation. In fact Didier was top of the turbo teams shopping list for 1979, but Tyrrell kept him to his contract, and thus he spent the year looking for an escape route, which he found in the shape of a move to Ligier for 1980. 
Overshadowing the incumbent, Jacques Laffite, with some stunning drives, Pironi took his first Grand Prix win at Zolder, and was unlucky not to win the British GP at Brands Hatch after a brilliant drive through the field. With Jody Scheckter heading for retirement another door opened for Didier, who joined Villeneuve at Maranello for 1981. The new turbo cars were unrefined, but Gilles was at his brilliant best, leaving Pironi groping somewhat for the first time. Clearly a single fourth place was unacceptable to Ferrari, but it was doubly so to Pironi, who resolved not to be found wanting in 1982. 
Four races into what was to prove a bitter and tragic season came a flashpoint at Imola when Pironi stole the win from Villeneuve on the last lap against team orders. All lines of communication between the two drivers were cut. Two weeks later at Zolder came Villeneuves horrendous fatal accident, and previous feudings were now irrelevant. Didier, now centre stage at Ferrari, unleashed a superb run of impressive performances which came to an end when, unsighted in pouring rain, he ran into Prosts Renault in practice for the German GP. Pironis season was over and his total of 39 points left him tantalisingly within touching distance of the title before Keke Rosberg edged him out by a mere five points. 
Although, almost miraculously, Pironis feet and ankles were saved, he would never regain the feel and movement necessary to allow him to return to the cockpit. For thrills he turned to the dangerous sport of powerboat racing, which became a lethal pastime when he crashed off the Isle of Wight in August 1987.";

To many he was simply what motor racing was all about. To the more dispassionate he was an accident waiting to happen, and when the end came, well, they were proved right werent they? 
In soccer, if the ball goes to a Pele or Best, or now Giggs, there is a collective sense of anticipation, a feeling that something special could be about to happen ... It was like that with Gilles. As an ordinary punter denied access to the inner sanctum of pit or paddock, you could stand on any corner, at any circuit and wait for his Ferrari to scream into view. Then came the reward. With a glint of wildness in his eyes, and the car at some wicked angle - more often than not at its very limit and then some - Villeneuve would pass and you could sense the thrill. 
Gilles raced snowmobiles for several years and tried drag racing before turning to Formula Ford in 1973. Winning seven out of ten races seemed to indicate that a move into Formula Atlantic would be needed to test his powers, but he was soon sidelined, but only for a month, by a fractured leg sustained in an accident at Mosport. Once back in the groove, he started to be noticed, especially after a race at Trois Rivieres in 1976 when James Hunt, no less, was soundly thrashed. Typically James told McLaren to sign this man up as soon as possible. The following July, the French-Canadian was in a McLaren - at Silverstone - but for only one race. He was to make the most of it, indulging in countless spins, which to most onlookers seemed to indicate he was in over his head. Gilles knew better; he was just finding the limits in a Grand Prix car and the only way to do that was to go up to and beyond the point of adhesion. Amazingly, Teddy Mayer felt that he could pass on Villeneuve, and so he was picked up by Ferrari. It could all have ended after just two races, for at Fuji he ran into the Tyrrell of Ronnie Peterson and his car somersaulted wildly into a prohibited area, killing two spectators. This time Gilles walked away... 
He was to be involved in a string of shunts at the start of 1978, some of his own making, some not. But he was undoubtedly quick and as the year wore on he got quicker. At Monza he and Andretti battled for the win, only for both drivers to be penalised for jumping the start. The last race of 1978 was in Canada, and Gilles finally scored his first Grand Prix win, but only after Jariers Lotus had hit trouble. He felt that his triumph was somehow devalued by that - not having won the race on merit took the gloss off the victory. In statistical terms 1979 was the season he could have won the World Championship, but it went instead to team-mate Jody Scheckter and Gilles supported the South African all the way. There were, of course, the moments of genius, such as his battle with Arnoux at Dijon, or his qualifying performance at Watkins Glen in the rain when he was eleven seconds quicker than Scheckter. There was also controversy, with his notorious return to the pits at Zandvoort with the rear wheel hanging off the Ferrari following a blown tyre and spin. Pure Gilles! 
In 1980 his efforts were handicapped by the truly awful handling of the Ferrari 312T5, which even the matchless skill of Villeneuve could do little to tame, but the new 126CK V6 car was a different proposition. Sure the chassis still needed to be refined, but the turbo power gave him a chance to compete on more equal terms with the Williamses and Brabhams. He took only two wins that year, but they were both memorable. At Monaco he pounced on Alan Jones faltering Williams to take an unlikely win when many would have long given up the race for lost. Then came an unforgettable performance at Jarama when he kept the snarling pack of cars in his wake for the bulk of the race to take a win one would not have believed possible. 
Certainly the cars of the period did a driver like Villeneuve no favours and by the time the 1982 season came round, he hated ground-effect and all it stood for. But he was being paid to drive and just got on with the job in typical fashion. At Imola, the Ferraris had it all their own way and Gilles had the race under control, until team-mate Pironi stole the victory from him on the last lap. Villeneuve was shocked, outraged and suffered every other conceivable hurt over the Fenchmans underhand tactics. He would not speak to him again - ever. 
Two weeks later at Zolder, Gilles was hardly any less anguished. He went out for practice, 100 per cent committed as usual, but this time he was not to return, for having touched the March of Jochen Mass his Ferrari cartwheeled across the track in an accident of sickening ferocity. The hapless driver was thrown from the car, receiving terrible injuries. There was no hope of survival, but while the little man had gone, the legend he left behind would never die.";

Back for more at the end of 1980, Paletti drove sensibly within his limits and, with the benefit of winter testing, he joined the Onyx team full-time for 1981. The year started well with his March taking a second place at Silverstone and a third at Thruxton, but then his season tailed off disappointingly. 
With the help of generous sponsorship, Paletti found himself a seat in the tiny Osella team for 1982, but the young Italian faced a steep learning curve. Sadly he never had the chance to progress, for in Montreal his Osella accelerated away from its place at the tail of the grid and hurtled into the back of the stalled Ferrari of Pironi at over 100 mph with devastating consequences. In a gruesome accident, Paletti suffered massive internal injuries and he died in hospital shortly afterwards.";

With three seasons of Formula Vee and Super Vee racing behind him, Brian took the plunge into F3 - initially with his own GRD before a move into the works March F3 team for 1974 really put him on the map. Easily winning the Lombard and Forward Trust championships, he graduated to Formula 2 and a brief and salutary stint with Lotus. This was followed by an abortive 1976 season after a planned drive with Tom Wheatcroft foundered after just one race, and Henton had to start all over again. 
His patriotic private British Formula One March got him back on the F1 grid, but he soon ran out of funds, so it was back to Formula 2 for 1978, Brian enjoying some success in his own car, and 1979, when he finished a close second to Marc Surer in the championship, winning at Mugello and Misano. With BP and Toleman behind him, Henton made no mistake the following year, taking the title and re-establishing himself as a serious proposition once more. 
Brian had certainly earned his move back into Grands Prix with Toleman, but the season was another major disappointment, the underdeveloped car beset by turbo problems. Henton could have been sunk without trace, but he managed to find a seat for 1982, first with Arrows, deputising for the injured Surer, and then at Tyrrell in place of Slim Borgudd. He did a solid job, nearly making the points, and was credited with fastest lap at Brands Hatch, but it was not enough for Tyrrell to retain him. A one-off drive into fourth place for Theodore in the 1983 Race of Champions rounded off a career which eventually failed to meet Hentons expectations, but it wasnt for want of trying.";

His interest in motor sport was kindled as a boy in his native Italy, and as soon as Mario was old enough to race seriously he set out with his twin brother Aldo on the US sprint and midget racing trail, finally winning the championship in 1964, the season which also saw his USAC debut. The following year he not only won the first of his four USAC/lndy Car titles but also took third place on his Indy 500 debut. He was champion again in 1966 and through until 1969 - when he won his only Indy 500 - Mario was the man to beat, even if luck was not always with him in terms of results. 
Andretti had idolised Ascari in his youth and gladly accepted the chance to go Grand Prix racing with Lotus, causing a sensation by putting his car on pole at Watkins Glen. His clashing USAC commitments limited his F1 appearances - and chances of success - with both Lotus and March, but he shone in sports cars, winning at Sebring and Watkins Glen for Ferrari in 1970, before achieving a dream by signing to race for the Scuderia in F1 in 1971. His start could not have been better, Mario winning the South African GP followed by the non-championship Questor GP, but at this stage he was still splitting his season between USAC racing and his Ferrari F1 and sports car programme, the latter proving most successful in 1972, when he took four wins in the 312P with Ickx. 
Mario concentrated on American racing in 1973-74, racing for Vels Parnelli in F5000 and USAC events, and in late 1974 he debuted the teams Grand Prix contender. He campaigned the VPJ4 throughout 1975 (and briefly in 1976) before Parnelli withdrew from F1, and then returned to a Lotus team in the doldrums. Together with Colin Chapman, he set about reviving the famous marques fortunes and by the end of the 1976 season they were back in the winners circle. Soon the teams ground-effect type 78 and 79 cars were in the ascendancy, Mario magnificently winning the 1978 World Championship title after scoring six wins. 
It was a different story in 1979 and 1980 as Lotus got it badly wrong, bogged down in a technical mire. Lured perhaps by sentiment as much as anything, Andretti joined Alfa Romeo in 1981, for what was to become another disappointing season, largely due to the inadequacies of the car. Mario drove as well as ever, comfortably outclassing his young team-mate Bruno Giacomelli, but decided to return to the States in 1982 to undertake a full Indy Car schedule, his first for some years, before a brief Formula 1 swansong with Ferrari. 
Thereafter Mario concentrated on Indy Car racing full-time, and soon took what was to be his last Indy Car crown in 1984. But for another decade, revelling in the comforting surroundings of the Newman-Haas team, he remained capable of giving anyone a race on his day. By the end of his Arrivederci Mario 1994 season, Andrettis Indy Car record was staggering. A record total of 407 starts, 52 wins and 66 pole positions are testimony to the enduring talent of this legendary figure. 
Of course the hunger to drive remained unsatiated, and the chance of winning the Le Mans 24 Hours (and thereby matching Graham Hills unique achievement of winning the World Championship, the Indy 500 and the Sarthe classic) was too much for Mario to pass up. He very nearly triumphed in 1995, but his minor shunt left the frustrated driver to make do with second place. After further unsuccessful attempts in the following two seasons it seemed that Andretti had finally had to admit defeat and leave this particular quest undone, but it has been reported that he intends to make another bid for victory in 2000.

In 1978 the Aurora AFX F1 series was inaugurated, and de Villota became a staunch supporter of the championship during its short life.

In 1981 he won the European Formula 2 championship with the Ralt-Honda, but even this could not bring Lees the big chance he had hoped for, and he eventually turned his back on Europe.

Things changed dramatically in 1976, with a more consistent Rupert winning nine rounds of the BP championship and the title to line up a seat in the Hesketh Grand Prix team for 1977.

Somewhat ambitiously, he managed to step into Grand Prix racing at the end of 1979, when Lauda suddenly quit at Montreal, and he started 1980 still driving the second Brabham BT49, but was eased out of the team in mid-season when Rebaque took his place. Ricardo was back with Brabham at the start of 1981, but only for the non-championship South African GP, in which he finished eighth. 
He then joined Tyrrell to contest the two South American rounds, before giving way to a shining new talent by the name of Michele Alboreto.";

With no previous experience, Jean-Pierre competed in the R8 Renault Gordini series in 1966 and won a few races, earning an invitation to drive in French F3 in a team with the more seasoned Philippe Vidal. The F3 scene was very competitive, but Jabouille made his mark in 1968 when he ran and maintained his own car, keeping out of trouble and earning enough prize money from one race to make it to the next. The series that year was dominated by Cevert, but Jean-Pierre won five races to finish runner-up and gain an end-of-year Formula 2 ride with Matra at Hockenheim.
Alpine offered him a contract for 1969 as number two to Depailler, and he stayed with the team as a test and development driver over the next few seasons, his rather fragmented racing programme doing little to further his ambitions. There were outings for Pygmee in F2 in 1970 and for Elf-Tecno the following season, when he finished second at Pau, and Jabouille also tried his hand at sports cars, taking a splendid second place in the Paris 1000 Km in a Ferrari 512S. The Frenchman's career seemed to be stuck in something of a rut in 1972 when he received decidedly 'second best' treatment in the Elf/John Coombs team, and made his feelings known. When he was given a March 722, things improved and he took second place at Mantorp Park. His lot was much the same in 1973, when much of his time was given over to the development of the Alpine A440 sports car, but he was loaned to Matra for Le Mans, sharing the third-placed car with Jaussaud.
In 1974 Jabouille made a couple of unsuccessful attempts to qualify for a Grand Prix with Williams and Surtees, but concentrated on the same mix as the year before, only this time with more success. In Formula 2 he won his first race at Hockenheim and, racing the Alpine, he finished runner-up in the European 2-litre series. Seconded to Matra for Le Mans again, he finished third once more, this time with Migault. Determined to improve upon his somewhat patchy record of success in Formula 2, Jabouille took the brave step of constructing his own chassis for 1975 with the support of Elf. He lost out to his great chum Laffite in the championship but, thanks to his connections with Elf, he at least had the consolation of a decent Grand Prix opportunity, qualifying the Tyrrell for the French GP. It was a popular triumph when Jean-Pierre finally clinched the Formula 2 title in 1976 with three wins, and no one begrudged the Parisian his hard-earned triumph.
This goal achieved, Jabouille then undertook the development work on the F1 Renault turbo project, accepting the early disappointments with equanimity as failure heaped upon failure over the first two seasons until the glorious moment for France and Renault when the car finally came good -fittingly at Dijon - in 1979. Although overshadowed by the sparkling Arnoux in 1980, Jean-Pierre took a shrewd and well-judged win at the Osterreichring before a crash in Montreal after a suspension failure left him with badly broken legs. Having already agreed to join Ligier for 1981, he made it back into the cockpit for the start of the season, but it soon became painfully obvious that he was far from fit and, with his leg injuries slow to heal, he decided to retire in mid-season.
Missing the thrill of competition, Jean-Pierre was soon back on the circuits, racing in the French Supertourisme series. His vast engineering and development experience later made a valuable contribution to Peugeot's successful sports car racing programme, and in 1993 he shared the third-placed car at Le Mans, before succeeding Jean Todt at the head of the French company's motor sport division as they prepared to enter Grand Prix racing as engine supplier to McLaren in 1994. It was to prove a torrid baptism for Peugeot, the newcomers perhaps underestimating the level of technology required to compete at the highest level. Certainly partnering McLaren, themselves in a trough after so many seasons of greatness, made the task even harder, although a parting of the ways less than twelve months later can have benefited neither concern. Eddie Jordan was delighted to step in and embrace the French giant but, after another troubled and inconclusive year in 1995, it was Jabouille's head that rolled when victory seemed no nearer.
In 1997 he formed his own very successful sports car team, initially running a Porsche 911 GT1 for Mauro Baldi and Emmanuel Collard, and latterly a Ferrari 333SP, with which Baldi and Laurent Redon took an outright win at Spa in 1999 in the International Sports Racing Series.";

Schooled in the French F3 championship, Patrick spent three seasons between 1967 and 1969 driving a works Alpine-Renault, but also had occasional races in the Alpine sports-prototype, taking a third place in the Monza 1000 Km of 1968. A switch to Formula 2 with the Elf-Pygmee team for 1970 proved something of a disaster, the final straw being a practice crash at the Salzburgring from which he was lucky to escape with slight burns. Luckily he still had the faith of Elf, who backed him again the following year but this time in a Tecno. Apart from a sixth place at Pau little went right for Depailler at this level, but he was more than happy to race the works Alpine-Renault once more, becoming the 1971 French F3 champion. 
By 1972 he was already 28 years of age and had left it quite late in motor racing terms if he was going to make the leap up into the big time. After winning the Monaco F3 race, it was third time lucky in his attempts to crack Formula 2, Patrick taking second places in the races at Pau, Enna and Albi. His performances in the Elf/John Coombs March 722 put him in the frame for a couple of rides with his old chum Ken Tyrrell. It was more of the same in 1973, when once again a win in F2 just seemed to elude him, poor Patrick having to settle for no fewer than four second places this time around, and even worse was to follow. A motor cycle accident left him with a broken leg and he was forced to miss the two drives in North America that Tyrrell had lined up for him. 
Fortunately his leg was soon to mend, and he was in the Tyrrell team full-time in 1974 with Jody Scheckter as his team-mate. In a highly competitive year, he brought the Tyrrell home in the points on six occasions and took a pole in Sweden, the first time a Frenchman had achieved this feat in a World Championship race, while in Formula 2 he finally broke his long dry spell, winning four rounds, at Pau, Mugello, Hockenheim and Vallelunga. 
Patrick stuck with Tyrrell to become Formula 1 racings nearly-man over the next three seasons, taking seven second places in Grands Prix (and another in the 1975 non-title Swiss GP) before an emotional triumph at Monaco in 1978. Lured to Ligier for the 1979 season, when the team were at their zenith, if only for a short spell, Patrick won the Spanish GP and lay equal third in the championship when a mid-season hang-gliding accident sidelined him with serious leg injuries. 
Struggling back to fitness, he joined Alfa Romeo in 1980, shrugging aside the frustrations of developing the unreliable car. He was beginning to make real progress when, in a solitary test session at Hockenheim, something went wrong with the car, probably a suspension breakage, depositing the helpless driver into the Armco at massive speed. He stood no chance of survival. Depailler had lived life to the full, and even in darker moments, as he fought the pain of his injuries, it would not be long before a broad smile would emerge, crinkling his face with laughter lines. A fitting way to remember him.";
229;"Jody Scheckter";28;29.1.1950;"Ист-Лондон";"Восточная Капская";"провинция";"Jody David Scheckter";"Джоди Шектер";"";"";"Jody was a prodigy who burst upon the motor racing scene in much the same manner as Ricardo Rodriguez had done a decade earlier. Immensely talented, brave almost to the point of being foolhardy and blindingly quick in any car he chose to drive, Jody somehow managed to avoid the Grim Reaper in those wild early days to become a dry-humoured, somewhat world-weary elder statesman who had got the risks under control and knew his destiny. 
Jody started his racing early, running a go-kart at 12 before moving on to motor cycles and then saloons by the age of 18. His home-built Renault proved to be tremendously successful in the youngsters hands, and he scored numerous victories before his racing took a back seat to a spell of National Service. Towards the end of 1970, Team Lawson entrusted their Mazda to the youngster in the Springbok series, and he finished fifth in the Bulawayo 3 Hours and won his class in the Goldfields 9 Hours. His immediate ambition, though, was to do well in the Formula Ford Sunshine series and thus win the Driver to Europe prize that went with it. Sure enough, young Jody in his Lola T200 Formula Ford did exactly that and was on his way to England early in 1971. 
The headstrong Scheckter got himself into a Merlyn at Brands, and sensationally led the race until he spun. This set the pattern for his short Formula Ford career. Spin or win seemed to be the order of the day until, after a few races, he felt he needed the tougher challenge of Formula 3, jumping into the deep end with an EMC and then a works Merlyn. By the end of the year he was winning at this level, in addition to hustling a Ford Escort Mexico indecently quickly. McLaren were first in with their pen, and Jody was signed to race for their Formula 2 team in 1972. 
Generally his luck was out with the McLaren M21, but he did manage one win in the Greater London Trophy at Crystal Palace. As a bonus the team gave him his Grand Prix debut at Watkins Glen, where he kept the lid on things and finished a creditable ninth. McLaren kept him on for the 1973 season, though with Revson and Hulme on board they didnt really have room to accommodate him. Perhaps they wished they hadnt when his 1973 Grand Prix season turned into a succession of accidents, the most serious incident being his infamous spin at the beginning of the British GP which not only halted the race but wiped out a good proportion of the field. Ever the paradox at this stage of his career, Jody also raced for Sid Taylor in America, winning the L & M F5000 series in a Trojan, and competed in Can-Am with a Porsche 917 -completely without mishap. 
With McLaren unable to offer Jody a firm deal for 1974, Ken Tyrrell stepped in and signed the South African to head his team, newly shorn of the retired Jackie Stewart and deceased Francois Cevert. It was to prove an inspired choice as the still relatively inexperienced charger took two Grand Prix wins and finished third in the championship table. Jody found it hard to maintain his scintillating form the following season, but he did have the wonderful bonus of winning the South African GP. In 1976 Tyrrell launched the bizarre but effective six-wheel P34 car. In Scheckters hands this became a serious machine, Jody taking it to a historic victory in Sweden and racking up the points regularly elsewhere to finish a creditable third in the World Championship behind Hunt and Lauda. It was also a year when Scheckter achieved another ambition by winning the Wynns 1000 Km at Kyalami in a BMW with Nilsson and Grohs.  
Out of sync with the Tyrrell philosophy, Jody took a big gamble in joining Wolf for 1977, but it paid off immediately when he gave the restructured team a winning debut in the Argentine GP. The car wasnt consistently good at every circuit, but Jody never let that become a problem. Two more wins were to follow and second place to Lauda in the championship was his reward. His 1978 season was not so productive, the new Wolf chassis being far more troublesome than the relatively straightforward machine of the previous year. An offer from Ferrari for 1979 was too good to refuse, and the wild man of the early days was now but a distant memory. Indeed, incredible though it may seem, he was now driving almost conservatively. Certainly he had everything weighed up and his performances were the model of economy, Scheckter doing just enough and no more, but he was able to clinch the World Championship in style, with a win at Monza. 
His ambition realised, Jody planned just one more year. As it happened it was easily the worst of his career, leaving the South African frustrated and a little bemused. The ultimate humiliation came at Montreal where he failed to qualify; he knew it was just one of those things, that circumstances had conspired against him, but it hurt his pride none the less. Scheckter came in with a bang but went out with a whimper, but he walked away unhurt and there were a few people who didnt believe that possible in 1973. 
Ever his own man, after retiring Jody settled in the United States and began a new life without even mentioning his achievements. Most of his new acquaintances knew nothing of Scheckter the Formula 1 World Champion, and thats exactly the way he wanted it as he built a highly successful business. However, Jody has now returned to Europe and over the past couple of years he has been much in evidence at races once more. His sons, Thomas and Toby, are making names for themselves in the junior single-seater formulae and dad regularly casts his paternal eye over their upward progress.";

And while he may have tempered his approach in the ensuing years, he was always liable to revert to type, leaving his competitors a little wary as they locked horns with the hard-racing Swiss. 
After competing with a Healey Sprite, Clay joined forces with fellow countryman Silvio Moser to race F2 and F3 Brabhams in 1965-66 before switching to Tecnos. Regazzoni joined the works team in 1968 to compete in the European Formula 2 championship, where some of his driving tactics became a cause for concern. Things reached a low ebb in mid-season, when he was disqualified for overtaking at the site of an accident at Monza and then, in the next race at Zandvoort, was involved in Chris Lamberts fatal accident. The fall-out from this incident was to last for some considerable time, and though Regazzoni was absolved from blame some mud would always stick. The 1969 season brought an invitation from Ferrari to race their 166 Dino, but little of note was achieved, and he soon returned to the Tecno ranks. This proved a wise decision, for the teams F2 car really came good in 1970. Up to this point Clay had been regarded as something of a neanderthal, but wins at Hockenheim, Paul Ricard, Enna and Imola helped dispel this image and he jumped into the Ferrari F1 team with no qualms at all. Fourth place on his debut was a great effort, but better was to come when, after a splendid second at the Osterreichring, he took the ultimate prize for a Ferrari driver, winning the Italian GP at Monza. His place was now secure, but over the next two seasons, apart from the Race of Champions in 1971, there were to be no more wins - some good performances to be sure, but too many incidents for the Scuderias liking. Thus at the end of 1972 he was released, but soon found a seat with the Marlboro BRM squad. 
Regazzoni took his change of circumstances with equanimity and started the season with a great drive in the Argentine GP, taking pole and leading the race for 30 laps before troubles dropped him back. His year was largely spent in midfield anonymity, however, before a surprise recall to Ferrari, who were restructuring after a terrible year. The 1974 season was probably the Swiss drivers finest. There were off-track excursions but he was a remarkably consistent finisher and took a superb win at the Nurburgring to get within touching distance of the World Championship. His value to Ferrari at this period was immense, Clay proving the ideal foil for Niki Lauda, quite capable of picking up the pieces if necessary, as in the non-title Swiss GP and then the Italian GP at Monza the following season. Unfortunately there was still the occasional brainstorm, and his tactics at Watkins Glen, where he blatantly blocked Fittipaldi, were a disgrace. In 1976 we saw the same cocktail - a brilliant win at Long Beach, and a crass first-corner manoeuvre at Paddock Bend in the infamous British GP. Certainly his form began to tail off towards the end of that year, and his services were no longer required. 
Joining the little Ensign squad for 1977 was akin to leaving the Ritz to dine at Wimpy, but Regazzoni was happy just to be part of the scene. There were, of course, the inevitable crashes, but a couple of fifth places near the end of the season kept Mo Nunn happy enough. Clay was tempted by the lure of Indianapolis that year, and qualified in a Theodore McLaren, but retired the car in the race with a water leak. His Swiss connections helped him into the Shadow team for 1978, but apart from Anderstorp it was a pretty dismal year. It was difficult to see much future for Regazzoni by this stage, but Frank Williams was to take Clay on board. He reasoned that in a good car he had been almost as quick as Lauda, and his experience would be an asset in the teams expanded two-car operation. Franks hunch was to prove correct, as Clay won at Silverstone to score the Williams teams first-ever Grand Prix win, and a special place in their history. Sentiment didnt cloud Williams judgement when it came to his 1980 line-up, however, and when Carlos Reutemann became available Regazzoni was out. 
Unperturbed, Clay counted his blessings and headed back to Ensign. The team now had a healthier budget and a new car, but the season was only four races old when disaster struck. In the Grand Prix at Long Beach, the brake pedal snapped, leaving his red, white and blue machine hurtling down the escape road into a parked Brabham. Poor Regazzoni sustained serious spinal damage, which has since confined him to a wheelchair, but despite this crippling injury Clay lost none of his enthusiasm for the sport, working regularly as a commentator for Swiss TV for more than a decade. 
Regazzoni even started competing again in specially adapted saloon cars, and he is was fully involved in developing the hand control systems for these cars.";
231;"Emerson Fittipaldi";2;12.12.1946;"Сан-Паулу";"Сан-Паулу";"штат";;"Эмерсон Фиттипальди";"";"";"Crowned the youngest-ever World Champion at 25 in 1972, Emerson Fittipaldi was one of the outstanding drivers of the seventies, but a spectacularly ill-judged career move at the end of 1975 turned him into a Grand Prix racing also-ran, before he came back from retirement to forge a second magnificent career and conquer the world of Indy Car racing. 
Success in Brazil led Fittipaldi to turn his sights to Europe. The sale of his Formula Vee car financed a three-month trip to England in 1969 and he quickly made his mark in a Formula Ford Merlyn. Emersons talent was obvious and a move up to F3 in a Jim Russell Lotus 59 paid immediate dividends, the Brazilian winning a string of races, which gave him the confidence to move into Formula 2 with Mike Warner in 1970. An outright win eluded him, but he finished virtually every race in the top six, and Colin Chapman soon had his signature on a Lotus F1 contract. 
Fittipaldi was eased onto the Grand Prix scene with a Lotus 49C, but tragedy soon befell the team with the death of Jochen Rindt at Monza. Emerson was suddenly thrust into the spotlight upon the teams return at Watkins Glen, and he provided a great morale booster for Chapman by winning the race, albeit only after Rodriguez hit trouble late on. For 1971 Fittipaldi was given the number one seat, but lost momentum after a mid-season road accident. Nevertheless he did remarkably well in his first full Formula 1 season and, with the Lotus 72 finely honed, he became the man to beat the following year. Victories in the Race of Champions and International Trophy provided the springboard for a mid-season burst of scintillating form which saw him claim the World Championship. 
Joined in the team by Ronnie Peterson for 1975, Emerson was quick straight out of the blocks with three wins in the first six Grands Prix, and a second title looked a formality, but his year then turned sour, particularly after a practice crash at Zandvoort left him with a niggling ankle injury. By the end of the season he was somewhat overshadowed by Peterson and accepted a big-money offer from McLaren for 1974. It proved to be a wise decision, his smooth, unruffled driving and great tactical acumen bringing him his second World Championship in an evenly contested season. The following year yielded just one Grand Prix win at Silverstone, Emerson keeping his head in a rainstorm while those all around were spinning out. In the end Laudas Ferrari had the legs of his McLaren, and he had to settle for second place in the championship. 
Then came the bombshell. He was to join the Copersucar-Fittipaldi team established by his brother Wilson for 1976 to drive the outfits well-funded but uncompetitive Brazilian-built challenger. From Olympian heights, Emerson soon found himself in a valley of despair as the project struggled on, occasionally breaking into the top six but achieving little else. A magnificent race at Rio in 1978, when he finished a brilliant second to Reutemanns Ferrari, and an excellent third place at Long Beach in 1980 were but isolated reminders of former glories. At the end of that season Emerson switched from driving to management duties but the Fittipaldi team was finally forced to close its doors at the end of 1982. 
Returning home to Brazil, he concentrated on the family orange-growing and automobile accessory businesses, not missing racing in the slightest. A few races in super karts for fun in 1983 led to an invitation to take part in an IMSA race at Miami early in 1984 and he enjoyed himself so much that he was soon tempted to accept an Indy Car drive at Long Beach, finishing a remarkable fifth. The wheel-to-wheel racing ignited Emersons lost passion for driving and he was soon to get a big break, joining the Patrick Racing team to replace the severely injured Chip Ganassi. With Fittipaldi as the focal point, the team steadily grew in stature, ultimate success arriving in 1989 when he not only won the PPG Indy Car World Series title but also took a famous last-gasp win in the Indy 500 after a coming-together with Al Unser Jnr on the penultimate lap. 
Emmo joined Roger Penskes three-car team in 1990, and was one of the undoubted top guns in the Indy Car championship. In 1993 he won the Indy 500 for the second time with a beautifully judged performance and finished second to Nigel Mansell in the points standings. Joined by Al Unser Jnr in an all-conquering three-car Penske squad for 1994, Fittipaldi proved that he still had plenty of racing mileage left. Despite recording only one win (at Phoenix), he was runner-up to the utterly dominant Unser in the PPG Cup ranking. His major disappointment came at Indianapolis where he threw the car into the wall with the race all but won. After this season of plenty for Team Penske 1995 came as a shock to the system, with Emmo and Unser struggling with the recalcitrant PC24. The nadir was the pairs failure to qualify at Indy, but there were some high spots too and Fittipaldi took a well-judged win at Nazareth. 
Although the inevitable rumours of his retirement abounded, Fittipaldi had no intention of giving up competition and he was back in 1996, running a Penske under the guidance of Carl Hogan. The Brazilian put in some spirited performances, but his season - and ultimately his career - came to an abrupt end when he crashed heavily in the Marlboro 500 at Michigan. 
Suffering from a crushed vertebra in his neck, the 49-year-old spent five hours in surgery and was fortunate not to have sustained permanent injury. While recovering, Emmo still hankered after a return to action, but another accident - a light aircraft crash in his native Brazil - in 1997 left him with serious back injuries. Wisely all thoughts of racing again were abandoned, but he is still a regular on the CART scene, guiding the career of the highly promising Brazilian Helio Castro-Neves.";

He temporarily forsook his racing activities to tend the cars of his elder brother Ernesto, before returning to two-wheel competition in 1968. The following year he burst upon the Italian national scene in his F3 Birel, and his forceful driving style soon found him dubbed the Monza Gorilla, partly due to his burly physique. 
Still relatively unknown, he moved into Formula 2 in 1970 with a Brabham BT23, taking a second place at the Salzburgring, and he was to spend another two years jumping between F2 and F3, gaining numerous successes in the latter category. It was the 1973 season which provided his big breakthrough. Vittorio had calmed his frenetic driving approach somewhat and, at the wheel of a well-sponsored March, he became a serious challenger for honours, looking particularly impressive as the season wore on and taking wins at the Salzburgring and Albi. 
Brambillas sponsors, Beta Tools, were so delighted that they helped him secure a place in the March Grand Prix line-up for 1974. Joining the team two races into the season, he soon proved to be as quick as team-mate Stuck, but the propensity to crash was still there. The following year was to be his best; he was much more consistent, qualified well and raced his heart out. In Sweden he was stunningly fast in practice, and simply drove away from the field at the start until tyre trouble intervened, a driveshaft then failing. His moment came in Austria, however, when he scored the March factory teams first-ever championship Grand Prix win in pouring rain at the Osterreichring. It made no difference to the exuberant Italian that he managed to dismantle the front of the car on the slowing-down lap - or that half-points were awarded as the race had been ended prematurely with the chequered flag rather than being stopped and then restarted as should have been the case. Max Mosley had read the rule book and nobody could argue against him! 
Unfortunately 1976 saw a return to the bad habits of old as in an effort to stay on the pace Brambilla indulged in a spate of chassis-crunching which must have driven the factory to distraction, such was the replacement tally. He scored only one points finish, but claimed a second in the International Trophy and fourth in the Race of Champions. However, the situation was redressed in 1977 when Brambilla took his Beta money to Surtees as number one driver. He had a pretty good working relationship with his demanding employer, and an excellent reliability record, though the car was just not quick enough for anything like outright success. 
Nevertheless the partnership continued into 1978, with the new TS20 a no more effective challenger than its predecessor. At Monza Vittorio was involved in the start crash which claimed the life of Peterson, suffering severe concussion which kept him out of the cockpit for almost a year, before Alfa Romeo (for whom he had won four rounds of the World Sports Car Championship in 1977 with their T33) brought him back for the last three races of the season. He made two more appearances for them in 1980, but it was painfully obvious that his days as a Grand Prix driver were over, though he did race the Osella sports car in a few rounds of the World Championship of Makes, before phasing himself out completely in 1981.";

239;"James Hunt";1;29.8.1947;"Белмонт, Саттон, Суррей";;;;"Джеймс Хант";"15.06.1993";"Уимблдон, Лондон";"Some drivers are cut out for the big stage, and undoubtedly James Hunt was a prime example. Here was a man who, having been quick but not at all convincing in his early career, took to Grand Prix racing like the proverbial duck to water, confounding his critics who had given him the unkind but not entirely inappropriate nickname of Hunt the Shunt. 
Though the son of a Surrey stockbroker, James had to finance his early racing career largely from his own pocket, stacking the shelves in his local Sainsburys in order to race his Mini before moving into Formula Ford in 1968 with an Alexis and then a Merlyn Mk11Ain 1969. Midway through the season James moved up to F5 with a Brabham BT21B, but found the competition hot gaining success only in Libre events at Brands Hatch. 
It was during the 1970 season, when he was equipped with a Lotus 59, that people began to sit up and take notice, and not only because of his wins at Rouen and Zolder, for late in the season he was involved in a last-corner collision with Dave Morgan which saw the irate James exact pugilistic retribution on the spot. His penchant for attracting controversy followed him into the 1971 season, which was littered with accidents and mechanical gremlins, but once again he proved beyond doubt that when trouble stayed away he was a serious contender. March certainly thought so as they signed him for their STP-backed works car in 1972, but the team fell apart and as luck would have it James joined forces with Lord Heskeths Dastle F3 team. Almost immediately Hesketh took the plunge into Formula 2 and Hunt placed the teams car on the front row at the Salzburgring in his first race. After a really good drive he was forced to pull out with engine trouble, but crucially James had proved to himself that he was good enough. In the next race he gave a superb display at Oulton Park to finish third and there was now no stopping the upward momentum of young Master James. 
Third place in the 1973 Race of Champions with a hired Surtees convinced Lord Hesketh that Hunt had the talent for the big time, and James proved his faith was not misplaced, putting in some sensational performances once the team had acquired a March 731, with his drives at Zandvoort and Watkins Glen, where he dogged the Lotus of Ronnie Peterson, standing out. The Hesketh bandwagon was really gathering pace by now, and in 1974 the team launched their own car, which proved an immediate success, with Hunt winning the International Trophy before embarking on an up-and-down Grand Prix season which was marred by trivial mechanical failures and some misjudgements on the part of the driver, but contained some race-performance gems, such as in Austria where he drove from 18th after a pit stop to third at the finish. His reputation was such that Dan Gurney invited him over to the States to drive his Eagle in US F5000 for three races, his best result being a second at the Monterrey GP. He also sampled sports cars, taking fourth at the Nurburgring 750 Km with Schuppan and Bell in John Wyers Gulf-Ford. 
That Hunt was a top-drawer racer was finally confirmed in 1975 when he drove the Hesketh to a magnificent win in the Dutch GP, defeating Laudas Ferrari. To prove it was no fluke, Hunt took three second places that year before the financial burden of running the team independently became too great for its aristocratic patron. Briefly James looked to be without a drive for 1976, but with Fittipaldis sudden defection to his familys Copersucar-backed project, Hunt found himself installed alongside Jochen Mass at McLaren. It was to be a season of high drama, controversy and courage, which saw James and his great pal Niki Lauda fight it out for the championship in a fashion which captured the imagination of the world at large and was surely instrumental in increasing the sports popularity during subsequent years. James soon asserted his number one status in the team by claiming pole in Brazil and then winning the Race of Champions and International Trophy. His first Grand Prix win for McLaren was contentious, Hunt being re-instated after a post-race disqualification in Spain, but a victory in France kept him in touch, and then came the famous British GP at Brands. Hunt, having been taken out by Regazzoni in a first-corner melee, won the restarted race but was then disqualified. His championship chances seemed over, but after Laudas fiery accident at the Nurburgring James had an outside chance. By the time the Austrian had bravely returned to the cockpit, Hunt had made inroads into his points lead, and once on a roll he proved difficult to resist with two brilliant wins in Canada and the US. The showdown in Japan was hyped more intensely than anything ever seen before, and while his rival withdrew Hunt stayed out on a flooded track to take third place and the coveted championship. 
James was now a public figure way beyond the confines of the sport, and perhaps this began to affect his racing. In 1977 he still put in some superb performances to win at Silverstone, Watkins Glen and Fuji, but his refusal to appear on the rostrum at the final race showed the more petulant side to his nature. The ground-effect Lotus was by this time in the ascendancy and McLaren were slow to follow this route, which left Hunt struggling in 1978, though it has to be said the drivers apparent lack of motivation certainly didnt help matters. Feeling a move would be beneficial for all concerned, Hunt switched to Walter Wolf for one final season in 1979, but the car proved difficult to handle and James seemed generally disinclined to give his all when there was little chance of outright success. Abruptly, and with no regrets, he quit the cockpit after the Monaco GP. 
Another career was soon to open up for the extremely articulate and self-opinionated Hunt. He joined Murray Walker in the BBCs commentary booth to form a wonderful partnership and would enliven many a dreary race with his astute and pithy comments. By the early nineties, despite well-publicised money worries, Hunts roller-coaster personal life had at last become settled, and it was a great shock when he died in 1993 after a massive heart attack at the age of 45.";
240;"Arturo Merzario";7;11.3.1943;"Чивенна, Комо";;;;"Артуро Мерцарио";"";"";"Little Art made his name in the late sixties with works Fiat Abarths in both GT and European mountain-climb events. If one race in particular advanced his career prospects, then it was the Mugello GP in 1969, which he won after a superb drive in the Abarth 2-litre, beating the likes of Vaccarella and de Adamich. This brought an invitation to join the Ferrari sports car team for 1970 and the start of a three-year association with the Scuderia. 
His best season was probably 1972, Merzario making a sparkling Grand Prix debut at Brands Hatch, winning the Spa 1000 Km with Redman, the Targa Florio with Munari and the Rand 9 Hours with Regazzoni in the 312P. In addition, racing for Abarth, he was crowned European 2-litre champion. The following season saw Ferrari in something of a trough, but Merzario knuckled down to a hit-and-miss season of Formula 1 while team leader Ickx just gave up. His feisty spirit appealed to Frank Williams, who signed him for 1974. The season began with a third place in the Medici GP at Brasilia, but once the serious business began success was elusive. The pair ploughed on into the 1975 season but Merzarios fortunes in Formula 1 could hardly have been worse. By mid-season he had quit Williams to concentrate on his commitments with the Alfa sports car team, taking their T33 to wins at Dijon, Monza, Enna and the Nurburgring. After a brief liaison with Copersucar at Monza, Arturo lined up a works March drive for 1976, but the strain of running a four-car team showed and the Italian, unhappy with his lot, grabbed the chance to join Wolf-Williams in mid-season following the sudden departure of Ickx. 
With no other options open to him, Merzario entered his own March in 1977 before the money ran out due to a lack of results. He had a good one-off drive for Shadow in Austria, but this was overlooked due to Alan Jones splendid win in the sister car. While his Grand Prix career had been heading for the rocks for some time, Arturo managed to salvage his reputation somewhat by continuing his sports car success with Alfa Romeo, and in 1977 he won championship rounds at Dijon, Enna, Estoril and Paul Ricard in Autodeltas last fling. The following year Merzario took the brave and ultimately completely foolhardy step of fielding his own F1 chassis. Two versions of this appalling device were built during the next two seasons but the cars rarely looked capable of qualifying. Very much the poorer but seemingly no wiser, the little Italian persisted with his folly in 1980, making an equally fruitless attempt to mix it with the constructors in Formula 2 with his Merzario M1-BMW, which was just as embarrassing as his Grand Prix contender. 
Arturo has returned to the tracks once more in the nineties, winning the inaugural Maserati Bi-turbo Cup race at Imola in 1995, and after driving in the Porsche Supercup the jaunty Italian has been a competitive force in various sports car races at both national and international level.";
241;"Hans Joachim Stuck";6;1.1.1951;"Грайнау, Гармиш-Партенкирхен";;;;"Ханс-Йоахим Штук";"";"";"As the son of the famous pre-war Auto Union ace, it was perhaps natural that Hans Jnr should follow his father into a career in motor racing, especially as he had driven karts and small-capacity BMWs long before he was eligible for a racing licence. After driving a BMW 2002 in national hill-climbs, he graduated to the works European touring car championship team, winning the Nurburgring 24-hour race in 1969. Stuck then took over from Jochen Mass in the Ford Germany Capri in the national series for 1972, and won the Spa 24 Hours with Mass as co-driver.
His single-seater career began properly in 1973 when he raced the works March in Formula 2, graduating to the Grand Prix team the following year, but he proved to be somewhat inconsistent, very quick on some occasions, but mysteriously lacklustre on others. He did well in F2, however, finishing second in the championship with four wins (at Barcelona, Hockenheim, Rouen and Enna).
Initially dropped from the March Grand Prix team for 1975, Stuck made a successful sortie into IMSA with BMW, but was then recalled to the Bicester ranks to replace the out-of-favour Lella Lombardi. He remained with the team in 1976, but it was the same infuriating mixture of the brilliant and the banal once more. At Watkins Glen Hans finished fifth, after being 23rd on the first lap, and occasional Formula 2 outings with the 762 produced three wins in only five starts.
Given the chance to race the Brabham-Alfa in 1977 following the death of Carlos Pace in an air crash, Hans scored superb third places in Germany and Austria, and led the US GP at Watkins Glen before blotting his copybook by sliding off the circuit. From then on it was downhill all the way as far as Formula 1 was concerned, a season with Shadow bringing only one points finish, and an even more dispiriting year with ATS yielding the same return.
Hans then turned his back on F1, but certainly not on motor sport, for he was soon immersed in a huge schedule of sports, GT and touring car racing. He joined the Rothmans Porsche team in 1985, sharing the drivers' crown with Derek Bell in both 1985 and 1986, and won Le Mans with Bell and Holbert in 1986 and '87. After a switch to Audi, his presence spiced up IMSA's GTO class in 1989, and back at home he won the 1990 DTM championship in the awesome 3.6-litre V8 quattro.
As the nineties unfolded Stuck was still racing competitively in German Super Touring for Audi and was a Le Mans regular. In 1994 he finished third with Sullivan and Boutsen in a Dauer Porsche 962LM, and the following year he was placed sixth, this time in a Kremer Porsche with Boutsen and Bouchut. Just as his career seemed to be winding down came the surprise news that he was forsaking Audi to join Opel's squad to contest the Class 11TC series in 1996. Driving the Team Rosberg car, he could still show the youngsters a thing or two, winning both rounds in Helsinki. He was also part of the factory Porsche team, taking second at Le Mans with Boutsen and Wollek in the 911 GTI In 1997 Hans teamed up with Boutsen to contest the FIA GT championship in one of the works cars but, despite a number of top-six placings, the experienced duo were deemed too old, and dropped at season's end.
The immensely popular Stuck shows no sign of hanging up his helmet and remains a quick and spectacular driver, mainly racing a BMW M3 in the GT3 class in the American Le Mans Series.";

243;"Jacky Ickx";19;1.1.1945;"Брюссель";;;;"Жаки Икс";"";"";"Here was a prodigy with the brio of Rindt and the controlled circumspection of Stewart, absolutely brilliant in the wet and endowed with such natural driving gifts that surely the World Championship would be a formality. In the end it was not to be, as his mercurial powers became diluted in a succession of less and less competitive cars. 
The son of a famous motor racing journalist, Jacky was three times Belgiums motor cycle trials champion before moving to cars, and quickly became the man to beat in his Lotus Cortina, taking his national saloon car championship in 1965. Though only 21, Ickx was pitched straight into a season of Formula 2 in 1966 under the guidance of Ken Tyrrell, who could see his vast potential. It was at the following years German GP that the young Jacky caused a sensation by qualifying the little Matra third fastest in practice, and though he had to start with the other Formula 2 cars at the back of the grid, he soon carved his way through the field to fourth place before his suspension broke. Now a hot property, he guested for Cooper at Monza to score his first championship point, before signing for Ferrari in 1968. 
His first great win was not long in coming, Ickx showing sublime control in the wet to win at Rouen, and his consistent placings left him with an outside championship chance until a practice crash in Canada scuppered his hopes. By this time he was already regarded as one of the worlds very best sports car drivers; racing for John Wyer, he had already won the Spa 1000 Km twice in addition to victories at Brands Hatch, Watkins Glen and Kyalami, and so anxious were Gulf to keep their prize asset that they arranged for Jacky to join Brabham for 1969. In the light of Ferraris plight that year, it was a smart move with Ickx reaching the heights of his considerable brilliance by defeating Jackie Stewart in the German GP. Another win followed in Canada, but Ickx had to be content with the runner-up spot in the championship that year. Meanwhile the wisdom of Gulfs decision was demonstrated when Jacky took a sensational last-gasp victory at Le Mans over Herrmanns Porsche. 
In 1970 he rejoined Ferrari to race in both Formula 1 and sports car events, but once again he was the nearly-man, just failing to overhaul the late Jochen Rindts points total after winning three Grands Prix. Apart from a non-title win in the Rindt Memorial race at Hockenheim, and yet another masterful display in the wet at Zandvoort, the following Grand Prix season was not as competitive as Ickx would have hoped, while in 1972 Ferrari were still a potent force, but not consistent enough. Jacky predictably took another superb win at the Nurburgring, as well as chalking up brilliant victories in the teams sports cars, races at Daytona, Sebring, Brands Hatch, the Osterreichring and Watkins Glen all surrendering to the Belgian that year alone. 
With Ferrari falling into one of their periodical troughs in 1973, Ickxs patience ran out by mid-season and he quit the team, freelancing for McLaren and Williams before joining Ronnie Peterson at Lotus for 1974. Apart from a memorable win in the Race of Champions, it was a disastrous move, the bewildered Belgian switching back and forth between the almost undriveable new Lotus 76 and the by now venerable 72E. Things got even worse in 1975, with Ickx and Lotus parting company in mid-season. By now his Formula 1 career was in the balance and a move to the Wolf-Williams team at the beginning of 1976 tipped him into the also-ran category. A brief spell at Ensign, ironically replacing Chris Amon, showed the spark was there, but a nasty crash at Watkins Glen convinced him his highly successful sports car career was a better bet. 
Jacky completed a remarkable hat-trick of Le Mans wins between 1975 and 1977, and won a string of rounds of the World Championship of Makes in the Martini Porsche partnered by Jochen Mass. In 1979 Ickx was back in the Grand Prix world, replacing the injured Depailler at Ligier, but sadly it was not a successful return, the finesse of his driving style not suited to the ground-effect cars of the time. Racing in Can-Am for Jim Hall, Ickx took the 1979 title, before concentrating almost exclusively on endurance racing in the eighties. After taking a fifth Le Mans win in 1981, he became a key member of the Rothmans Porsche team the following season and won the drivers World Championship, scoring a record sixth win at Le Mans in addition to victories at Spa, Fuji and Brands Hatch. Jacky continued to race successfully through to the end of the 1985 season, when he took honourable retirement, hailed not only as one of the all-time greats of sports car racing but also, by those who remembered his halcyon days, as one of Grand Prix racings most brilliant talents.";

The car was extremely difficult to handle, and Patrick, though very brave, qualified only twice in five races before he in turn was replaced by Marc Surer.

His career continued its upward trend with a factory F3 March in 1975, which led to a full season for the team in Formula 2 in 1976. Although a win eluded him, he was, with Arnoux, usually the fastest man around. 
Hiring a Hesketh, Alex made a steady F1 debut in the US GP, before taking on his only full Grand Prix season with a works March in 1977. It was to be a disastrous campaign, with drivers and management blaming each other for the cars disappointing performances. 
Back in Formula 2 in 1978 with his own Jesus Saves Racing March 782, Alex initially showed he had lost none of his talent with a brilliant win at the Nurburgring, but gradually his season tailed off and the little team lost heart. In 1979 Ribeiro reappeared with Fittipaldi at the non-championship Dino Ferrari GP, but retired early on. He was later invited to drive for the team in the end-of-season North American races, but failed to qualify the car on both occasions.

Милан, Италия";;;"Ронни Петерсон";"11.09.1978";"Милан, Италия";"Everybody loved Ronnie. Whatever your allegiances, the big blond Swede was the entertainer of the early seventies, thrilling everyone with his astonishing car control. Just watching him drift a Lotus 72 through the old Woodcote Corner was worth the price of admission alone. With all that natural talent, he should surely have been a World Champion, but sadly luck decreed otherwise. 
Ronnie was Swedish karting champion between 1963 and 1966 and then switched to Formula 3, at first in a home-brewed special before acquiring a Tecno for 1968. This proved to be a wise move as he took his national championship, and gained a place in the works F3 team for the following year. At this time his big rival was compatriot Reine Wisell, and he and Ronnie were to have many duels in the 1-litre F3 formula. Peterson won the prestigious Monaco race during a successful 1969 season which brought the offer of a three-year contract with March from 1970. He gained some valuable experience in his first year with the Colin Crabbe-entered F1 car and ran a full season of Formula 2 guided by Malcolm Guthrie. 
Promoted to the full works teams the following season, he quickly established himself as one of the worlds leading talents, scoring four second places in Grands Prix to finish as runner-up in the World Championship, while in Formula 2 he displayed Rindt-like qualities to take the European championship with five wins. Locked into the final year of his March deal, Peterson was lumbered with the hopeless 721X in 1972 and things improved only marginally when the hastily cobbled-together 721G was pressed into service. His racing in F2 was limited by a successful sports car programme for Ferrari; teamed with Schenken, he won at Buenos Aires and the Nurburgring and took four second places. 
Ronnie joined Lotus for 1973 but his slow start to the season eventually counted against him when a late burst of four wins took him into third place in the championship. So dominant was his form that team-mate Emerson Fittipaldi opted for McLaren for 1974, allowing Jacky Ickx to partner Peterson. The season was desperately disappointing because of the difficulties experienced with the new Lotus 76, but the compensation for the Swedes army of admirers was the opportunity to savour his sublime driving talent a little longer at the wheel of the now aged Lotus 72E. Wins at Monaco, Dijon and Monza were the stuff of true genius. Peterson was forced to soldier on in the old faithful during 1975 while a new car was prepared, and he could no longer compensate for its deficiencies. Unfortunately, when the Type 77 was introduced at the opening race of 1976 it appeared to be another lemon, and then Ronnie contrived to collide with new team-mate Mario Andretti. This was the final straw for Peterson, who engineered a move back to March for the rest of the season. In the underfinanced little teams car he managed to score a brilliant win at Monza, before being tempted to Tyrrell for 1977. However, the six-wheeler was just not suited to Ronnies style, and he was regularly outpaced by team-mate Depailler. By the end of the year his reputation had been seriously dented, but salvation was nigh. Colin Chapman took him back, albeit strictly as number two to Andretti, to race the superb Lotus 79. 
Keeping his word, Peterson was content to play the support role in the team. Mario headed for his deserved championship win and Ronnie picked up the crumbs, in the shape of wins in South Africa and Austria. However, tragedy lay around the corner. At Monza he became embroiled in a first-lap multiple crash, which left him suffering from severe leg injuries. Worse was to come, for once in hospital complications set in. He slipped into a coma and within hours he was gone. The sense of disbelief was matched only by the grief felt throughout motor racing.

For 1972 Brett came to Europe to race in Formula 2 as well with a works-supported March 722, but could not match his Stateside success. 
Lunger stayed in F5000 on both sides of the Atlantic until 1975, when he finally got a taste of Grand Prix racing with Hesketh, contesting three races in a second car alongside James Hunt.

Dannys struggles in F1 in 1978 - he scraped onto the grid for the first two Grands Prix in the works Ensign, then floundered with the embarrassing Interscope Shadow - were in sharp contrast to his rapidly blossoming career in USAC, where he took five wins in the Parnelli VPJ6. 
Although Danny enjoyed further success for Interscope in IMSA sports car events, winning the 1979 Daytona 24 Hours in a Porsche, and taking third place the following year, this was the high point of his Indy Car career, as he was to suffer appalling leg injuries in a crash at Indianapolis in 1981.

After campaigning his private Porsche 904 GTS in 1964-65, Rolf was invited to join the works team for endurance racing. He soon became a key member of the team, winning the 1967 Targa Florio with Paul Hawkins, and the Daytona 24 Hours and Paris 1000 Km in 1968, as well as taking many placings. He was also successfully involved in Porsches European mountain-climb programme with the 2-litre Bergspyder. 
After dipping his toe into the water by competing in the 1969 German GP with a hired F2 Lotus, Stommelen gained sponsorship for a full F1 season in 1970 with a works Brabham and showed distinct promise, highlighted by a brilliant drive in Austria when he drove from 18th to finish third. He was also busy making his mark in Formula 2 with the Eifelland Caravans-backed Brabham, and was a works driver for the Alfa Romeo sports car team, for whom he drove until 1974. 
For 1971, Stommelen took his sponsorship money to Surtees, but the partnership produced little and relationships were strained, so it was no surprise when he branched out on his own for 1972 with the curious-looking March-based Eifelland-Ford, which performed even more lamely than its appearance promised. Temporarily on the Formula 1 sidelines after this fiasco, Stommelen grabbed the lifeline of a Brabham drive after de Adamichs accident at Silverstone in 1973, and was then called up to replace Guy Edwards in the Embassy Hill Lola in mid-1974. 
Rolf got on well with Hill and secured a seat for 1975, but his first race in the new Hill GH1 at the trouble-torn Spanish GP ended in disaster when a wing stay failed while he was leading the race. The car was pitched into the crowd, killing four spectators and seriously injuring the driver. Happily Rolf soon recovered and returned later in the year, but by that time Tony Brise had emerged as Hills prize asset. 
For 1976 Stommelen returned to sports car racing with Martini Porsche, winning at Enna and Watkins Glen, and this helped him to a couple of rides in the works Brabham that season. The following year he won the Nurburgring 1000 Km for Porsche, and also took the German national touring car title in the Gelo Racing 935 turbo.

To this end Bleekemolen embarked on a full season of European Formula 3 in 1978, finishing fifth in the series, and then, again with the help of his F & S Properties backing, he joined ATS for another unsuccessful sortie into the world of Grands Prix.

After three years (1975-77) in Canadian Formula Atlantic, where he was somewhat overshadowed by the exploits of Gilles Villeneuve, Bobby crossed the Atlantic for a selection of Formula 3 races with Walter Wolf Racing. He did well enough to be offered a drive with the team in the end-of-season United States and Canadian GPs, the latter in the old WR1 chassis, which had been dragged from a museum after he had pranged his WR5 in practice. 
Determined to make the grade, he came back to Europe in 1979 for a full Formula 2 season with a works Chevron, scoring some good finishes in a car which was not the most competitive in the series. That was the end of Rahals dreams of Formula 1, however, for in 1980 he went Can-Am racing, which was to be followed by a successful year in endurance events, Bobby winning the Daytona 24 Hours and taking second place at Brands Hatch in a Porsche 935 turbo. 
In 1982 he moved into Indy Car racing, winning the Cleveland race and finishing second in the PPG Cup, and in 1986, racing for Truesports, Rahal won the championship and the Indy 500. He won the title again in 1992, having set up his own team in partnership with Carl Hogan. 
After this third championship Bobby raced on to the end of the 1998 season, and although he failed to add to his 24 career wins Rahal remained a canny and robust racer who could never be discounted, given his still-burning desire to succeed.

Driving a variety of machines from Renault Gordinis to Formula Vee cars and a potent Alfa Romeo T33/2, Carlos took the Brazilian national championship three years in a row between 1967 and 1969. 
Together with Wilson Fittipaldi, Carlos arrived in Europe in 1970 to contest a very competitive Formula 3 series with a Lotus 59 entered by Jim Russell. Despite his lack of knowledge of the British circuits, Pace was soon very much one of the front-runners and by the end of the year he had collected the Forward Trust championship. After spending his winter at home, where he endured a disappointing Torneio series, Carlos returned with a healthy dose of sponsorship which was eagerly accepted by Frank Williams, who provided a March for the Formula 2 season. Just as in F3 the previous year, Pace became one of the men to beat, and soon won a round at Imola, though the entry for this race wasnt one of the best. 
Frank was keen to run Pace in his second F1 car in 1972, and the pair went 50/50 on a deal. While the unfortunate number one driver, Pescarolo, had a dreadful time, Carlos made good progress in the old March, taking valuable championship points in two of his first four races. Broadening his horizons, he briefly raced in Formula 2 with Pygmee, and then joined Ferraris sports car team to take second place in the Osterreichring 1000 Km, which brought an invitation from Gulf to race their Mirage at Watkins Glen, where he took third place. Late in the 1972 season, Pace dropped a bombshell on Williams by announcing his intention to join Surtees in 1973, and by the end-of-year Victory Race he was already installed in one of Big Johns cars, taking second place in the TS9B. In 1973 he raced regularly for Surtees in Formula 1 and was a revelation. The highlights were his performances in Germany and Austria, but too many mechanical problems left him lowly placed in the final championship table. In tandem with F1, he drove for Ferrari in sports car events and, teamed with Merzario, took a string of placings, including second at Le Mans and the Nurburgring. 
Despite the poor reliability of the Surtees, Carlos stayed with the team for 1974, but after a fourth place in his home GP, a succession of niggling problems blighted his prospects, and in mid-season he quit in frustration. It didnt take long for Bernie Ecclestone to bring him into the Brabham team alongside Carlos Reutemann and he soon proved to be every bit as competitive as his team-mate. A great drive in Austria was halted by a broken fuel line when victory seemed possible and he posted fastest race laps at Monza and Watkins Glen, where he served due notice of his intentions for the 1975 season. At Interlagos came the highlight of his career, his first Grand Prix win recorded in front of his ecstatic home fans, but luck rarely went his way throughout the year. His competitiveness was severely blunted in 1976 when Brabham ran Alfa Romeo engines, but he got stuck in and never gave up in his efforts to develop the car. 
By the end of the year he was enthusiastic about his prospects for 1977. Second place in the Argentine Grand Prix vindicated his optimism, but prior to the start of the European season came the terrible news of his death in a light plane crash back in Brazil.";

Ian made his Grand Prix debut at Kyalami in 1974 and had a handful of Formula 1 outings over the next couple of years, but it was only after he had finally clinched the South African championship (by now for Formula Atlantic cars) in 1976 that he took up the offer of a full-time Grand Prix drive with March in 1977. 
The season was an utter shambles for the bewildered Scheckter, who managed just two finishes from 13 starts, and his Formula 1 career was buried.

The quiet and reserved Welshman had got into motor racing in 1970 via a competition in the Daily Express in which he won a Lola T200 Formula Ford. He made a good start in the car before switching to the Formula Ford 100 series in 1971, where he dominated in his TAS Racing Royale. This success took him to the works Royale team to race in Formula Super Vee before embarking on a Formula 3 season with the team in 1972. Unfortunately this effort was hampered by a lack of finance, and Toms season was interrupted by a broken leg sustained in a heat of the Monaco F3 race. 
Royale ran Tom in Formula Atlantic in 1973 and he was enjoying a successful season when he was given an opportunity to drive the Motul Rondel F2 car in selected races. A second place at Norisring signified better things ahead, and sure enough in 1974 Tom joined the little Token team for the International Trophy and Belgian GP. When the teams entry for Monaco was refused due to the Welshmans lack of experience, he contested the F3 support race instead and, in an astonishing display of dominance, simply drove into the distance to win by the proverbial country mile. 
With Shadow still looking for a suitable replacement for the late Peter Revson, Pryce was drafted into the team after Brian Redman had decided not to stay. In only his second race at Dijon he put the car onto the second row of the grid and that was enough for Don Nichols to decide he had found his man. The 1975 season started well with a win in the Race of Champions, but it was an up-and-down year, pole position for the British GP and superb drives in both Germany and Austria being the highlights. The team received a major setback when UOP, their main sponsor, pulled out at the end of the year and the subsequent cash shortage certainly hindered both the teams and Toms progress in 1976, the Welshman loyally staying on when plenty of others would have been seeking to better their lot elsewhere. The 1977 season began with new sponsors and a fresh enthusiasm, but a bizarre and horrendous accident at Kyalami cruelly cut him down.

With the team beset by all sorts of problems, Hoffmanns difficulties were inevitably very much secondary to those of the team leader and after just two races of the 1977 season the second car was withdrawn, leaving the unhappy Ingo to concentrate on a programme of Formula 2 for Project Four with a Ralt. 
Although outright success eluded him in this class, he proved to be a very quick and tough competitor, and produced some great performances - particularly in 1978, his last season in Europe, in the Project Four March. It is a shame that a second Grand Prix chance did not come the Brazilians way, but since his return home he has become an eight-times winner in the Brazilian stock car championship with more than forty wins to his name.

Zorzi started the 1976 season in the newly constituted Wolf-Williams equipe, but was dropped after just one Grand Prix, being replaced by Michel Leclere. For Zorzi, it was back to F3 in a Modus while he waited for a further opportunity, which came in 1977, when Francesco Ambrosio sponsored his drive in the Shadow team.

Having made a late start in the sport, Gunnar had his first full season of racing in Formula Super Vee in 1973, learning a great deal in a short time from the experienced Freddy Kottulinsky, who was instrumental in his early development. He also tried his hand at Formula 2 at Norisring and, given his novice status, did remarkably well to finish a lucky fourth on aggregate with a GRD. In 1974 he raced in the German Polifac F3 championship in a private March, and impressed sufficiently to bargain his way into the works team contesting the British series alongside Alex Ribeiro in 1975. Things could hardly have started better, as he won the first race at Thruxton to set up his year, which ended with him taking the BP championship. An end-of-season switch to Formula Atlantic merely underlined his talent as he won the last five rounds in succession in a Chevron B29. 
Though tied to March and BMW for 1976, Nilsson got together with Ronnie Peterson to contrive a swap deal which saw Gunnar join the Lotus team at a time when it was at a low ebb. It was a gamble, but it soon paid off with Nilsson on the rostrum in his third race. The arrival of Mario Andretti only strengthened the teams hand as they sought to recapture past glories, and Gunnar benefited greatly from the American drivers guidance. Ken Tyrrell, no less, predicted that here was a future World Champion - praise indeed. 
Happy to stay with Lotus for another year in 1977, Nilsson maintained his upward momentum during the first half of the season, culminating in his only Grand Prix win in the wet at Zolder when he memorably moved through the field before picking off the leader Niki Lauda with clinical precision. The second half of the year saw a sudden downturn in his fortunes as inconsistency set in. Of course no one knew it, but the cancer he had developed was already well advanced. With Peterson returning to the Lotus fold for 1978, Gunnar signed for the newly formed Arrows team, but in the event he was never well enough to drive the car.

Once in Europe, Perkins finished fifth in the 1972 Formula Ford Festival before taking a shot at Formula 3 in 1973, his season improving after he switched to a Brabham. In 1974 Larry was involved in the ill-fated Amon F1 project and an unhappy attempt to qualify at the Nurburgring, before re-establishing his career back in F3 in 1975 with the works Ralt, winning the European championship. 
Perkins landed a deal to drive the Boro (nee Ensign) for the first part of 1976, and then came his big chance with Brabham, replacing the Ferrari-bound Reutemann for the final three races. To be frank, he blew it and found himself signing a contract to race the truly awful Stanley-BRM in 1977. After two races he gratefully jumped from the sinking ship, subsequently appearing briefly and unsuccessfully with Surtees.

He began racing with a big Cobra in 1968, then moved on to a Chevron GT, before taking a shot at Formula 3 in 1970 in his family-backed Lee Refrigeration Brabham. At this stage he was a little wild and wayward, and he certainly relished the dangerous challenge presented by events such as the GP of Chimay, taking a hat-trick of wins on this road circuit between 1970 and 72. 
By 1972 Purley had progressed to Formula 2, taking a splendid third place at Pau, but in 1973 he dropped down for a season of Formula Atlantic, during the course of which he hired a March to go Grand Prix racing for the first time. Although his results were forgettable, his actions at the Dutch GP when he single-handedly tried in vain to save poor Roger Williamson were certainly not. Davids bravery won him the George Medal, and the admiration of the Grand Prix world. 
In 1974 Purley teamed up with Peter Harper to race in Formula 2 once more and enjoyed a successful season, taking second places at the Salzburgring, Rouen and Enna, and in the end-of-year Macau GP. Back under his own Lee banner, Purley then contested two seasons of F5000 with a Chevron, taking the Shellsport championship in 1976 with six victories. 
Seeing Formula 1 as unfinished business, David commissioned his own Lee chassis to race in 1977, taking a sixth place in the Race of Champions, and then briefly leading the wet Belgian GP during a round of pit stops. Disaster struck in practice for the British GP when he crashed his car, sustaining horrendous multiple injuries that would have killed a man of lesser fortitude. Displaying incredible will to survive and then recover, Purley endured months of rehabilitation, racing his Porsche in club events in preparation for a serious return to the track in the Aurora series towards the end of 1979. He may have competed in only four rounds, but a fourth place at Snetterton was an amazing achievement. 
Purley then restricted his racing to occasional club events, but his love for speed and danger remained unquenchable.

There was little time to contemplate a racing career until he was bitten by the bug after a visit to a racing school and a drive in a Formula Vee car at the Nurburgring. 
By wheeling and dealing in second-hand cars he scraped together enough cash to buy a Brabham BT21 and, at the relatively late age of 29, began his racing career. 
Conny became trapped in F3 from 1970 to 1976 by his lack of the finance to move into higher spheres. But in his travels he acquitted himself well against the likes of Hunt, Scheckter, Jabouille and Lafflte, who were all carving out top-line careers for themselves. In 1974, armed with a March-Toyota, he took six wins, four seconds and four thirds from twenty starts and began to be considered a serious prospect. 
More success followed in 1975, despite the disappointment of a win in the Monaco F3 race which was taken away when he was penalised for jumping the start. This drive caught the eye of John Surtees, who gave him an end-of-season test in one of his F1 cars, but he failed to land a full-time ride for 1976, so it was back to the European championship, where he was particularly unlucky to be pipped by Riccardo Patrese for the title.

He really came to prominence, however, driving a Lotus Elan, with which he embarrassed many a more powerful GT car in 1965, before moving into single-seaters the following year, when he showed much promise but achieved little success in Formula 3. 
Jacks breakthrough year was 1967 when he drove the Lotus Components F2 car, doing himself a power of good in the eyes of Colin Chapman by taking fifth overall and the F2 class win in the German GP. With the death of Jim Clark at Hockenheim, Oliver was promoted into the Lotus team as number two to Graham Hill, but had something of a torrid baptism, crashing in both the Monaco and French GPs before redeeming himself with a splendid performance at Brands Hatch, where he led the British GP until engine failure. Seen as nothing more than a stop-gap by Chapman, who had set his heart on having Jochen Rindt in the team, Oliver bowed out with a fine third place in Mexico to take up a two-year contract with BRM. 
The following season was a miserable one for BRM, but Oliver salvaged his year by racing for John Wyers Gulf team. Paired with Ickx, he won at Sebring and they then scored a famous victory at Le Mans, Jacks contribution to which is often overlooked. The second year of his BRM deal brought scarcely more joy than the first, even though he had the excellent P153 to drive. Apart from a fifth place in Austria and a third in the Gold Cup at Oulton Park, the catalogue of retirements made depressing reading. Jacks sharp, young, Essex personality didnt sit well with Louis Stanley, who preferred drivers typical of a different era, so a parting of the ways was probably inevitable. The season was not completely lost, for Oliver ventured into Can-Am with the Autocast project and took 
three second places. Meanwhile he returned to sports cars once more with Wyer, winning the Daytona 24 Hours and Monza 1000 Km, but was released after he preferred to take up an invitation to race Don Nichols Shadow in Can-Am. Keen to keep his Formula 1 career afloat, Oliver arranged some drives in a third McLaren, and his versatility was proven when he stood in for Mark Donohue in Penskes Trans-Am Javelin to take third place at Riverside. 
With the 1972 British GP being held at Brands Hatch (one of Jacks favourite circuits), he drove for BRM, but he spent most of the season testing Shadows latest Can-Am car. He got on well with Don Nichols, and when Shadow entered Grand Prix racing the following year Oliver had one of the drives. It was a perplexing season, with the DN1 chassis proving difficult to sort, but a wet race in Canada saw Jack take third place - although many insist that in fact he won, as the lap charts were thrown into confusion by the use of a pace car. Oliver concentrated on Can-Am alone in 1974 and it paid off handsomely with him winning the series at the fourth attempt in Nichols machines. Although increasingly involved in the management side of things, Oliver contested the 1975 and 1976 US F5000 series, before a Formula 1 swansong as a driver in 1977. He took the Shadow DN8 into fifth place at the Race of Champions, and later in the year raced in his final Grand Prix in Sweden, finishing ninth. 
Along with Alan Rees and Tony Southgate, Oliver quit Shadow at the end of the year and unveiled the 1978 Arrows Formula 1 car, which was subsequently the subject of legal action from Nichols over design copyright. Jack then spent the next decade keeping Arrows on the F1 grid but in 1990 he sold out to the Japanese Footwork concern, whose name the team took. Oliver remained at the helm as a director, and regained control of the team at the end of 1993 when the parent company hit financial difficulties in Japan. The Arrows name was back. 
In 1996 Oliver sold a major portion of the team to Tom Walkinshaw and was content to take a back-seat role as the new incumbent set about trying to end Arrows winless streak, which has now lasted for more than two decades. At the start of 1999 Jack finally disposed of his remaining interest in the team he founded, walking away an exceedingly wealthy man after the reportedly massive buyout.";

Her hopes of continuing with March in 1976 were dashed when she lost her backing after the first race of the season, and her brief flirtation with the RAM team was predictably fruitless.

He had begun his racing career in a Sprite before moving into Formula Ford and then F3 in 1971, but only after he had fortunately recovered from a broken neck sustained when he crashed while testing at Castle Combe. 
It was F5000 that was to provide Bob with his big breakthrough. With a solid season in a Trojan under his belt, long-time supporter Alan McKechnie bought him a Lola T332 for 1974 and he duly swept to the Rothmans championship, picking up the first-place Grovewood Award in the process. 
This led to an offer to drive for BRM in 1975. The car was well past its best and it was to Evans credit that he plugged away so valiantly in the face of adversity. Things looked better for 1976 when Colin Chapman, impressed with his performances, gave Bob a testing contract - and three races, the best of which was the Race of Champions, when the car ran out fuel and fourth place was lost. 
Apart from a RAM drive in the British GP later that year, and a one-off outing to 11th place in the Hexagon Penske in the 1977 Race of Champions, that was that for Evans, who returned to the relative obscurity of the Aurora championship in a Surtees TS19 in 1978.";

287;"Chris Amon";38;20.7.1943;"Буллс";;;;;"";"";"Chris Amon will always be best remembered as a notoriously unlucky driver who never managed to win a World Championship Grand Prix, for whenever he seemed poised to triumph dame fortune frowned and poor Chrissie was left to rue his unkind fate. 
A New Zealand sheep farmers son, Chris was racing a Maserati 250F by the age of 18, and he so impressed Reg Parnell in the 1962-65 winter series that he was invited to join the Parnell Grand Prix line-up at the tender age of 19. Amon learned quickly with the team, but the patrons untimely death was a big blow, and by 1965 Chris was spending most of his time with Bruce McLaren and his fledgling organisation, racing his big Elva sports cars. A proposed 1966 Grand Prix season with McLaren failed to get off the ground due to a lack of engines, so it was more sports car racing in Britain and in the Can-Am series, topped by a wonderful win for Ford at Le Mans with Bruce. 
Amons successful season was closely watched by Ferrari, who signed him for 1967. He got off to an encouraging start with wins in the Daytona 24 Hours and Monza 1000 Km, but then came turmoil. With Bandini killed, Parkes injured and Scarfiotti quitting, a huge burden fell on Chriss shoulders and he responded brilliantly with a string of great drives which continued into the following season, coming closest to a win in the 1968 British GP where he had a classic battle with Jo Siffert. The 1969 season started brightly, Chris taking a Dino 166 to the Tasman series and winning the championship, but the strain of the factorys huge racing programme was beginning to show, and F1 suffered most. Frustrated, Chris jumped ship to drive the new works March in 1970, winning the International Trophy and taking a superb second to Rodriguez at Spa, but the teams limitations were soon apparent and, despite an excellent run of placings, he signed a big two-year deal with Matra for 1971-72. A splendid aggregate win in the non-title Argentine GP boded well only for luck to desert him at crucial times, most cruelly at Monza when he lost his visor, and then at Clermont Ferrand when nobody could live with him until a puncture intervened. 
With Matras withdrawal, Chris agreed a return to March for 1973 but a disagreement saw him sensationally sacked at the start of the year. It was to be the start of a downward Formula 1 spiral for the Kiwi, who became progressively dispirited as he saw his efforts go to waste, first at Tecno and then disastrously in 1974 with his own Amon project. Even guest drives for Tyrrell and BRM failed to ignite the latent spark until, seemingly washed up, Chris accepted a drive in Mo Nunns Ensign late in 1975. Suddenly there was a sense of purpose and in 1976 the old Amon was back, with a superb drive at Kyalami until a fuel problem halted his progress. The new MN176 was a cracking little chassis and Chris really flew, but unfortunately it was fragile and after a couple of very lucky escapes when things broke he decided to get out in one piece, finally quitting F1 for good after being T-boned in a practice collision at Mosport driving for Wolf. Although he raced briefly in Can-Am in 1977, Chris then married for the second time and returned to New Zealand to tend the family farm.";

It proved to be something of a false start to his F3 career, as his car was not ready until mid-season. It was a different story in 1967, however, when he became the man to beat, winning the European championship. His victories that year included the important events at Barcelona, Monaco, Rouen and Zandvoort, so his promotion to the Formula 2 team in 1968 was a formality. Supporting Beltoise, Henri put in some excellent drives, taking second places at Barcelona, Hockenheim, Zandvoort and Hockenheim again before finishing the year with his first win at Albi. Highly regarded by Matra, he was given a run in the second V12 car in the end-of-season Grands Prix. 
Pescarolos career then received a big setback when, while testing the Matra sports car at Le Mans, he crashed on the Mulsanne Straight and suffered serious burns which laid him low until mid-season. Henri did well to return at the German GP, where he took the F2 Matra into fifth place overall and won the small-capacity class, and the season ended on a bright note when he shared the MS630 sports car with Beltoise to win the Paris 1000 Km at Montlhery. With Matra now committed to their own Grand Prix project once more, Beltoise returned from his year with Tyrrell and Pescarolo joined him in the Matra V12s. Henri put in some solid performances that year, with a third place at Monaco his best finish. He was also a member of the sports car squad, taking victory in the Buenos Aires 1000 Km with Beltoise. 
Pescarolo was surplus to requirements at Matra in 1971 and took some backing from Motul to Frank Williams, which enabled the team to go racing in both F1 and F2. Henri started the season with the old March 701 and picked up a second place on aggregate in the non-title Argentine GP, but Frank Williams was soon over-extended both financially and logistically, which showed in the teams preparation and lack of competitiveness as the year wore on. Meanwhile Pescarolo pursued a parallel programme in sports cars with Alfa Romeo, winning the BOAC 1000 Km with de Adamich. Despite all the problems, Henri was back in the Williams fold in 1972. It turned out to be a miserable season for all concerned as his March 721 was involved in a succession of crashes which required extensive and expensive rebuilds and, to cap it all, the prototype Politoys was written off in the midst of all this on its Brands Hatch debut. Fortunately Pescarolo escaped the carnage largely unhurt, and was buoyed up by his Le Mans win with Graham Hill in the Matra. Racing for the smart Rondel squad in Formula 2, Henri also won at Enna that year, and took another victory at Thruxton in 1973 after bringing Motul sponsorship to the team. With only the occasional Grand Prix ride that season, Pescarolo returned to Matra for a hugely successful programme of sports car racing, winning at Vallelunga, Dijon, Le Mans (for the second time), the Osterreichring and Watkins Glen. 
With Motul backing once more, Pescarolo made a full-time return to Grand Prix racing with BRM in 1974, but the team had lost their way, and his only decent finish came in the International Trophy where he was fourth. His partnership with Larrousse at Matra was still a potent one, however, and Henri completed a hat-trick of Le Mans victories and scored other wins at Monza and the Osterreichring. By now, of course, he was widely recognised as one of sports car racings best talents and in 1975 he returned to Alfa Romeo, winning rounds at Spa, the Osterreichring and Watkins Glen, all with Derek Bell. 
Henri made a last attempt to find success in Formula 1 with a privately entered Surtees in 1976, but neither he nor the car was remotely competitive. From then on Pescarolo concentrated on his sports car career, taking a fourth win at Le Mans in 1984, and raising his tally of World Championship victories to 21 by the end of 1986. 
In 1991 he shared the winning Porsche at the Daytona 24-hour race and he subsequently continued his career Stateside in IMSA, before focusing his efforts on Le Mans with the Courage C36. 
Henri has more recently looked after Elfs La Filiere young driver scheme which has helped so many French drivers to the top echelons of the sport. In 1999 he entered his own Courage C36-Porsche to register a remarkable 33rd Le Mans 24 Hours start, finishing in ninth place.";

Invited to lead the BRM team for 1975, poor Wilds only lasted two races before the Stanley axe fell.

By this time Donohue had been taken under the wing of Walt Hansgen, who was leading the works Ford Mk II sports car challenge in 1966. The pair shared second place at Sebring that year, Donohues first major placing, but his mentor was tragically killed at the Le Mans testing in April, and Mark renewed an old association with Roger Penske, taking his Group 7 Lola-Chevrolet to a victory at Mosport in Can-Am before winning the 1967 and 1968 US Road Racing Championships. 
Penske also entered Donohue in the Trans-Am championship in 1968, and Mark won ten of the 15 events to win the title easily, repeating the trick the following year with six wins from 12 starts. The 1969 season also saw Penskes first appearance at the Indy 500 as an entrant, Donohue qualifying fourth and finishing seventh to earn the Rookie of the Year title. He was to finish second in the race in 1970 driving a Lola-Ford, and later on that season raced in Formula A, winning two of the three rounds he entered. Penske expanded his racing activities in 1971 and Mark faced a hectic schedule of Trans-Am (taking his third title), USAC (winning the Pocono 500 and the Michigan 200 in a McLaren) and sports car events, sharing a blue-painted Ferrari 512M with David Hobbs. However, his performance of the year was undoubtedly his Grand Prix debut at Mosport, Donohue taking a superb third place in Penskes McLaren M19A. 
Grand Prix racing was just a diversion at this stage, for in 1972 Mark continued to race in USAC, duly winning the Indianapolis 500 in a Penske McLaren, and returned to Can-Am, where his title chances were ruined by a testing accident which saw him sidelined for a couple of months. He was back in 1975, however, and made no mistake this time round, taking six race victories and the championship in a Porsche 917. Mark announced his retirement at the end of the year, but was tempted back behind the wheel late in 1974 to apply his superb development expertise to the Penske Grand Prix challenger. 
He was persuaded to race the car in 1975, but it was a disappointment to all concerned and Penske replaced it in mid-season with an off-the-shelf March.

Ordinary people, particularly those who had only a passing interest in the sport, took to this suave but somehow homely character, who could charm and amuse in a way which, say, the reserved Clark, opinionated Surtees or rather earnest Stewart could not - due in part, perhaps, to the fact that he had started his career from nothing and shown unbelievable single-mindedness and much courage, not to mention an appetite for hard work, to reach the very top of his profession. 
The early days were spent scrounging drives in return for his services as a mechanic, before he began racing regularly in 1956 in Lotus and Cooper sports cars. In fact, he was working as a mechanic for Colin Chapman, who didnt consider him that seriously as a driver until he had proved himself elsewhere. When Lotus entered Grand Prix racing in 1958, Graham was back as a driver, making his debut at Monaco, where a wheel fell off. His two seasons with the fragile Lotus 16 were largely unsuccessful, the cars suffering all sorts of failures. 
For 1960 he joined BRM, who had won a Grand Prix and were theoretically better placed to further his career. He missed the chance of his first Grand Prix win at Silverstone that year when, having taken the lead from Jack Brabham, a slight error brought a heavy penalty when he spun into retirement. If outright victory was still elusive, then at least he was now finishing races, and consolidating his position as a fine all-rounder by driving for Porsche in Formula 2 and sports cars, taking third and a class win in the Buenos Aires 1000 Km with Bonnier. After another barren year in 1961 when the British four-cylinder cars were outclassed by Ferrari, it was win or bust for the BRM team with the threat of closure if success was not achieved in 1962. Armed with the new V8-engined car, Graham responded brilliantly by winning the Dutch GP, and then, after losing seemingly certain triumphs in both the Monaco and French GPs, he took the BRM to three more victories to claim a thoroughly deserved first World Championship. 
The next three seasons saw some magnificent racing with Hill battling it out for supremacy with Clark, Surtees, Gurney et al., and coming very close to a second title in Mexico City in 1964, where an accidental collision with Bandini cost him his chance. However, the championship seemed to be of less importance in those days, each race carrying more weight in its own right. Memorably he took a hat-trick of wins in both the Monaco and US GPs, but there were many great drives which brought only podium finishes, such was the level of competition. 
Graham was certainly one of the most active drivers of the period, and every weekend he seemed to be flying somewhere to race, handling a bewildering array of machinery from Seattle to Kyalami, or Karlskoga to Pukekohe. Driving Ferrari sports and GT cars for Maranello Concessionaires, he won the 1963 and 1964 Tourist Trophy races and the 1964 Reims 12 Hours and Paris 1000 Km, as well as taking second place at Le Mans the same year - all co-driving with Bonnier. Graham was unable to add to his tally of Grand Prix wins during the first year of the 3-litre formula in 1966, but he scored a contentious victory after a confused finish at the Indianapolis 500. 
It was a great surprise when Hill moved camps in 1967, joining Jim Clark at Lotus, to race the new Ford-Cosworth-engined Lotus 49. Its potential was enormous, and Graham was back in the hunt, but he had to endure a string of disappointments as his car fell prey to niggling maladies. Everything changed on 7 April 1968, when the team was devastated by the death of Jim Clark at Hockenheim. Graham helped restore morale by immediately winning the next two races in Spain and Monaco, and as the season wore on he resisted the challenges of Stewart and Hulme to take his second championship. Joined by Jochen Rindt in 1969, Hill won his fifth Monaco GP, but was soon overshadowed by the Austrian and the season ended in near-disaster when he was thrown from his Lotus at Watkins Glen when a tyre deflated, suffering badly broken legs. 
Now aged 40, many believed it was time for him to retire, but Graham was no quitter and sheer bloody-mindedness saw him back in the cockpit of Rob Walkers Lotus at Kyalami despite still being almost unable to walk. Surprisingly he managed some points finishes early on and drove superbly in the Race of Champions to take fourth place despite gearbox trouble, but with Walkers Lotus 72 late in arriving the season petered out. Moving to Brabham for 1971, Graham won the International Trophy in the new lobster-claw BT34, but had a thin time of it elsewhere. In Formula 2 he led the smart Rondel team, winning a thrilling race at Thruxton from Ronnie Peterson to show there was life in the old dog yet, but in truth a slow decline had already set in. His second season at Brabham was thoroughly lacklustre, and the year was illuminated only by his victory in the Le Mans 24 Hours for Matra with Pescarolo, Graham thus completing the unique achievement of winning the World Championship, the Indy 500 and the Sarthe classic. 
With no prospect of a decent works drive in Grands Prix, Hill took the logical step of setting up his own team, showing some spirit with the difficult-to-handle Shadow in 1973 but getting nowhere fast in the reliable but heavy Lola the following year. In 1975 Graham took the decision to build his own car, but after failing to qualify at Monaco he remained out of the cockpit until announcing his retirement at the British GP meeting. Of course, by this time Graham had taken on Tony Brise, and felt he had in his charge a future champion. However, returning from a test session with the teams latest car at Paul Ricard in late November, Hill, piloting his own plane, clipped the tree tops in dense fog over Arkley golf course while approaching Elstree airfield and crashed. Not only did one of motor racings great figures perish, so too did poor Brise and four other team members.";
298;"Wilson Fittipaldi";2;25.12.1943;"Сан-Паулу";;;;;"";"";"Wilson had to content himself with life as a racing driver for ever in the shadow of his brilliant younger brother, but that should not disguise the fact that he was a more than useful performer in his own right. 
He made a brief and dispiriting trip to Europe in 1966 before returning home to Brazil, where he raced saloons, sports cars and Formula Fords, as well as acting as engineer for Emersons Super Vee efforts. Wilson was back in Europe in 1970 to race in F3, and a good showing was enough to see him joining his brother in Formula 2 in 1971, driving first a Lotus 69, then a March. Given his lack of experience, he fared well, taking fourth on his debut at Hockenheim, second at Vallelunga and third again at Hockenheim at seasons end. A deal was struck with Bernie Ecclestone to race a Brabham in Formula 1 in 1972, as effectively the third driver to Reutemann and Hill, but he did not enjoy the best of luck after a sixth place on his debut in the non-championship Brazilian GP. Things were better the following year, and his drive at Monaco was particularly impressive, Wilson holding third place in the BT42 when the fuel system failed. But at least he scored some points in Argentina and Germany, and took an aggregate win in Formula 2 at Misano. 
Wilson was now set on developing a Grand Prix car of his own and much of 1974 was spent setting up the Copersucar-Fittipaldi team which made its debut in 1975. The car was not a success, and Wilson was a perpetual back-marker. At the end of the year came the shock announcement that Emerson would drive for the team in 1976, so the elder Fittipaldi happily retired to fill a management position in a project which was doomed to eventual failure. 
Over the past decade Wilson has been much in evidence at the circuits, helping guide the racing career of his son Christian, but he has still found time to race himself occasionally. In 1995 he won the 24th Brazilian 1000-mile race in a Porsche 993 turbo.";

When the premier domestic single-seater class switched to Formula Atlantic, Tunmer raced his own front-running Chevron B34 in 1976.

It was the purchase of an F5000 Surtees in 1972 which put him on the map as Gold Star champion in that class. 
He then raced a Tyrrell 004 and then an ex-Fittipaldi Lotus 72 in the domestic series, and naturally the local Grands Prix as well. Eddie loved the Lotus, setting his fastest-ever lap time at Kyalami with it, but it was to prove unreliable and he endured a terrible run of mechanical failures with the car. 
At the end of 1975 it was decided that the South African championship was no longer able to sustain pukka Formula 1 machinery for financial reasons and the premier class was henceforth to be for Formula Atlantic cars. These relatively underpowered machines held little appeal for Eddie, who moved into the South African touring car championship with his own team, running a BMW 535, and won the title twice more in 1977 and 1978. 
He crowned his career by scoring a great victory in the Wynns 1000 at Kyalami in 1979, when he was forced to drive for most of the race after his co-driver, Helmut Kelleners, was taken ill, defeating such luminaries as Watson, Mass, Surer and Stuck. When Ian Scheckter suffered a neck injury, Keizan was back in the BMW in the Wynns in 1980 but this time an almost certain victory was lost when a driveshaft broke. 
With his thriving business interests taking up more of his time, Eddie did not race again for ten years, but thereafter he occasionally donned his overalls to drive a BMW in South African endurance events.";
301;"Dave Charlton";28;27.10.1936;"Броттон, Редкар, Йоркшир, Англия";;;;;"";"";"After club racing, Charlton moved into South Africas major league in 1962, racing under the intriguingly titled Ecurie Tomahawk banner. Driving a four-cylinder-powered Lotus 20, he fared reasonably well on the local scene, but the car was not even good enough to qualify for practice in the 1965 Grand Prix. 
The purchase of a Brabham BT11 brought him to the forefront in South Africas national series, and helped ensure that he would be on the grid for the countrys feature race as well. Building his reputation with Scuderia Scribante, Charlton was invited to England in early 1968 to test a works Cooper, also taking in the BOAC 500 in Sid Taylors Lola T70. 
In 1970 Dave purchased the ex-Bonnier Lotus 49C, which he used to devastating effect, cleaning up in the F1/FA series. This led to a deal to drive a works-run Brabham in the following years Grand Prix, but more importantly secured lucrative sponsorship from Lucky Strike which allowed him to buy a Lotus 72 after his 49 was severely damaged in the 1971 Natal Winter Trophy. He raced the new car with great success, winning the 1972 series by a country mile to the chagrin of his great rival, John Love. Charlton blotted his copybook by spinning out of the 1973 Grand Prix and causing a multiple shunt, but success was to continue unabated when the Lotus was replaced by a McLaren M23. He comfortably won the 1974 series, but was extremely lucky to prevail over his new young challenger Ian Scheckter the following season - his consistency paid off and his six second places and one win were enough. The 1976 season was to see the beginning of the end of Charltons domination. The championship was now run to Formula Atlantic rules and his Modus did not inspire quite the same awe among his competitors. By mid-1978 he had lost his long-time sponsorship deal and eventually forsook single-seaters for saloons, which he raced into the early eighties.";

Yet at the beginning of 1974, no one had been interested in securing the talents of the man who had just won the John Player F3 championship outright and, with Richard Robarts, was joint Lombard North Central champion. He lacked the necessary finance to secure a seat in the March team for a season of Formula 2 and, despite a second place in the F3 Monaco support race, was thus consigned to a season of racing in Formula Atlantic. 
Having come from a motor sport family - his father John was a 500 cc and stock car racer - it was natural that young Tony would involve himself in some way. He started racing karts from the age of 8, eventually becoming joint British karting champion in 1969. By now keen to try his hand at Formula Ford, but without the resources, Brise contented himself with karting until, late in 1970, the opportunity finally arose to drive an Elden - not the best of chassis but at least it was a start. He raced the car in 1971 before replacing it with a more competitive Merlyn to finish his first full season as runner-up in the BOC Formula Ford championship. 
Bernie Ecclestone had spotted Tonys talent and offered him a Brabham BT28 for 1972, but this car turned out to be uncompetitive and only when he switched to a GRD did his fortunes improve. Mike Warner of GRD was another who wasnt slow to see Brises talent and he signed him for 1973 to replace poor Roger Williamson who was bound for F1 where he was destined to meet his terrible fate at Zandvoort. As described earlier Brise did the business, but only Teddy Savory was there to back him in 1974 with the Modus Atlantic drive. 
Of Brise the Grand Prix driver, sadly, we were to see precious little, but at each of the ten Grands Prix Tony contested, be it in practice or the race itself, his brilliance was evident. His loss in the plane crash that also claimed the life of Graham Hill and four members of the Hill team was a devastating blow for all followers of British motor racing, who felt they had lost a future World Champion.";

Nevertheless, he bravely got on with the job, hampered at first by having to make do with the 74 car and then being sidelined with a broken cheekbone and concussion after a testing accident in an F5000 car.

Francois marked time somewhat in 1973 with the F2 Pygmee, before joining compatriots Beltoise and Pescarolo in the Motul-backed BRM team for 1974. Despite making do with the worst of machinery, as befitted the third driver, Migault did well to qualify the car for most of the races, his best result being a fifth place in the International Trophy. Subsequently he scraped a handful of rides in 1975 with Hill and Williams, but nothing of note was achieved before an equally moribund year in Formula 2 with the works Osella in 1976. 
Already experienced in sports cars, Francois had shared a Matra with Jabouille to take third place at Le Mans in 1974, and went one better in 1976, finishing second in the Mirage GRS.

312;"Denny Hulme";38;18.6.1936;"Нельсон";;;;;"04.10.1992";"трасса Батхерст, Новый Южный Уэльс, Австралия";"If there can be such a thing as an unfashionable World Champion, then that is what Denny Hulme was. Self-effacing to the point of anonymity in his public persona, he eschewed the glamorous trappings that Grand Prix racing had to offer, but in fact he was no shrinking violet and his inner determination was second to none, born of many years working as a humble mechanic. 
After making an impact on the local scene, he came to Europe in 1960 with George Lawton on the New Zealand Driver to Europe scheme, racing a Cooper in Formula 2 and Formula Junior around the Continent. Unfortunately poor Lawton was soon killed at Roskilde Ring but Hulme carried on before returning home to contest his local series early in 1961. He was soon back in Europe, carving out a reputation for himself in Ken Tyrrells Cooper and the works Brabham, replacing the retired Gavin Youl. 
While still working as a mechanic at Brabham, Hulme took over the leadership of the Junior team in 1963, winning seven of the 14 races he entered. Although top-flight chances were limited, Jack was shrewd enough to realise the young New Zealanders potential and took him down to the 1964 Tasman series, where he won at Levin and finished second in the New Zealand GP. Supporting his boss in the Formula 2 championship that year, Denny won two races, at Clermont Ferrand and Zolder, with plenty of other good placings besides. In 1965 Brabham had the problem of running himself, Gurney and Hulme, so he shuffled the pack to ensure that Hulme was well prepared for the 3-litre formula, and Denny backed Black Jack superbly in 1966 as his mentor enjoyed an Indian summer and took the championship. As well as having another successful Formula 2 season, Denny also raced sports cars, taking second place at Le Mans with Ken Miles in a Ford GT40, and winning the Tourist Trophy and Martini International in Sid Taylors Lola. 
In 1967 it was Hulmes turn to take the spotlight. His wins in the Monaco and German GPs were the outstanding performances, but he scored points in all but two races to edge out his boss and claim the drivers crown for himself. Typically thinking ahead, Denny had already decided to join forces with fellow Kiwi Bruce McLaren in 1968, and he started the year in the teams new bright-orange livery. An early-season win in the International Trophy and then third to Bruce in the Race of Champions indicated things were on the right track, and sure enough Hulmes consistent approach put him in with an outside title chance after wins at Monza and Mont Tremblant. In the end his efforts fell short, but as a team McLaren had established themselves as a front-line outfit in both Formula 1 and Can-Am, which proved a lucrative sideline for both driver and constructor. Hulme took the Can-Am title that year, but this success could have been a double-edged sword, for the 1969 Grand Prix season only provided Denny with an end-of-season win in Mexico. 
The following season should have been a real breakthrough year for the team, but instead it saw catastrophe as McLaren was killed in a testing accident, and Hulme was involved in a practice crash at Indy which left him with nasty burns to hands and feet. That the team recovered so well from Bruces loss was a great credit to Denny, who hid his own devastation and gave the team a new sense of purpose by winning the Can-Am championship for the second time. From then on the tough New Zealanders approach became more circumspect. If he could sniff the scent of victory then he would really get stuck in, as we saw at Kyalami in 1972 and Sweden in 1973, but generally he drove within his limits. He was always a factor, even in his final season in 1974 when he pounced to claim a win in Argentina after a patient race. But after he had been on the scene of Peter Revsons fatal accident at Kyalami, he was generally content to let younger lions risk their necks before unobtrusively easing himself into a retirement of sorts. 
Though Formula 1 was in the past, the lure of competition was too strong, and from 1978 he raced touring cars and trucks as and when the fancy took him with all the grit and determination he showed in his heyday. He was competing in the Bathurst 1000 Km in October 1992 when suddenly he pulled his BMW M3 over and parked neatly on the grass alongside the Armco barrier. For a while nothing happened, and when marshals arrived they found Denny dead, still strapped into the car, having apparently suffered a heart attack at the early age of 56.";
313;"Mike Hailwood";1;2.4.1940;"Грейт-Милтон, Бирмингем";;;;;"23.03.1981";"Бирмингем";"Despite being the son of a brash millionaire, Mike Hailwood was totally without affectation and truly one of racings nice guys. He lived life to the full, but was nevertheless a dedicated sportsman who was undoubtedly one of motor cycle racings greatest-ever exponents -many consider him the greatest of them all - and a fine all-round racing driver who missed out on ultimate success but still left a not inconsiderable mark on the four-wheeled sport. 
By the age of 18 he was already a British motor cycle champion in four classes, winning his first World Championship in 1961. During the next six seasons Mike took a further eight World Championships in the 500 cc, 350 cc and 250 cc classes. His first taste of four-wheeled competition came in 1963, and with a couple of Junior races satisfactorily completed he joined the Reg Parnell team briefly in preparation for a full season the following year. He scored a World Championship point at Monaco in 1964 but felt uncomfortable in the Formula 1 environment, perhaps frustrated at being an also-ran in one category and the top dog in the other. He did a few more races for Parnell in 1965 before concentrating almost exclusively on bikes once more, though he did enjoy some winter sunshine racing sports cars, winning the 1966 Dickie Dale 3 Hours with David Hobbs in Bernard Whites GT40. 
With Honda having pulled out of Grand Prix motor cycle racing at the end of 1967, the sport was heading for a period of essentially privateer participation, so Mike turned to cars once again from the beginning of 1969. The newly inaugurated F5000 series provided an ideal base to rebuild his career, and in tandem he began a successful sports car programme, mainly for John Wyer, finishing third at Le Mans in 1969. In 1971 he joined forces with John Surtees to race his F5000 car, and benefited greatly from his guidance, taking second place in the series behind Frank Gardner. Late in the year, Surtees put Mike into his Formula 1 team for the Italian GP with startling results. In a great drive, Hailwood jousted for the lead in the four-car bunch which slipstreamed around the Monza circuit before finishing fourth. 
Full of confidence, he lined up a massive programme with Surtees for 1972, undertaking the F2 Brazilian Torneio and F5000 Tasman series before the season proper had even started. A second place in the Race of Champions boded well for Formula 1, but Mikes luck was definitely out. In South Africa he put in an astounding drive to pressure Stewart before his suspension broke and at Monza he knew he had the opposition covered before the airbox blew off his Surtees. No one deserved a Grand Prix win more that year, but it was not to be. There was, however, the compensation of taking the European Formula 2 championship for Surtees with some excellent performances. 
Unfortunately the progress made was not built upon in 1973, when unreliability beset the team to the extent that Mike failed to finish a single race in the points. In fact his season was best remembered for a typical act of bravery when he rescued Clay Regazzoni from his blazing car in South Africa to earn the George Medal. His only success came in endurance racing, when he shared the John Wyer Mirage with Derek Bell to win the Spa 1000 Km. 
Frustrated at his lack of success at Surtees, Hailwood switched to McLaren in 1974, running a third works car in Yardley livery. Suddenly he was back in the frame, always running competitively until an accident at the German Grand Prix left him with such a badly broken leg that it was to spell the end of his Grand Prix career. 
He announced his retirement in 1975, but after a couple of years kicking his heels Mike the Bike was back. In a sensational return to the Isle of Man TT races in 1978, he won the Formula 1 event on a Ducati and in 1979 he was back again to smash the lap record and take the Senior TT on his Suzuki. There were no more comebacks, however, for in 1981 Mike lost his life in a tragic road accident when his car ran into a lorry executing an illegal U-turn across a dual carriageway after he had nipped out for a fish and chip family supper.

He made his four-wheel debut at Le Mans in 1963, winning the Index of Performance, but a year later his career was nearly ended when a horrendous accident at Reims left him with burns and multiple injuries, the most serious of which was a left arm so badly broken that its movement was permanently restricted. Nevertheless he was back in 1965 racing the F5 Matra (the aerospace company having taken over the Rene Bonnet concern) and scored a great first win for the marque at Reims. His pre-eminence in this formula was later to be confirmed when he won the 1966 Monaco F3 race, and all four rounds of the Argentine Temporada series early in 1967. This success encouraged Matra to continue with their racing activities, and Beltoise was the spearhead of the team's Formula 2 programme from 1966, winning the F2 class of the German GP and later the European F2 championship for non-graded drivers in 1968 when he won rounds at Hockenheim, Jarama and Zandvoort.
Although he contested a number of Grands Prix in a ballasted F2 Matra, Beltoise had to wait until early 1968 to get his hands on the team's raucous V12-engined F1 car but was soon showing its potential with a brilliant second place and fastest lap at Zandvoort. In 1969 Beltoise was placed in Ken Tyrrell's team as number two to Stewart while development work was undertaken on the V12 project and scored seven point-scoring finishes, but the following season he raced the new Matra MS120-V12 and was unlucky not to win the French GP when a puncture robbed him of the lead. Although Jean-Pierre had done well enough on occasion, Matra signed Amon for 1971, frustrating the Frenchman's F1 aspirations, and it was not a happy season for Beltoise, who received a suspension when he was blamed for his involvement in the fatal accident that befell Giunti in the Buenos Aires 1000 Km.
In 1972 he moved to BRM, where he was soon to enjoy his day of days, winning the Monaco GP with a scintillating performance in pouring rain. A second place in the International Trophy and a win in the John Player Victory race at Brands Hatch merely disguised the team's imminent decline, but Beltoise was to stay on until 1974, with a fantastic drive into second place at Kyalami in the P201 the only highlight of his final season with the team. An established member of the Matra squad, Jean-Pierre enjoyed a tremendous year in sports car racing, winning four championship rounds (the Nurburgring, Watkins Glen, Paul Ricard and Brands Hatch) but at season's end he was looking for work on two fronts. With Matra out of endurance racing, Beltoise was forced to scratch around for drives and the prospect of an F1 return with Ligier in 1976 evaporated when the seat went to Laffite. Jean-Pierre was involved with both the Ligier and Inaltera sports car projects before successfully switching to the French touring car scene, where he was to drive and gain much enjoyment for many years.
As seems to be becoming more prevalent nowadays, Beltoise now has the pleasure of charting the progress of his sons, Julien and Anthony, as they climb the racing ladder.";
315;"Howden  Ganley";38;24.12.1941;"Гамильтон";;;;;"";"";"It took a long time for Ganley to realise his ambition to become a Grand Prix driver - which was fired by a visit as a youngster in his native New Zealand to the Grand Prix at Ardmore in 1955. He sailed for England in 1961 with just $50 in his pocket, and found employment as a mechanic preparing cars at a racing school. The urge to drive was occasionally satisfied over the next few years, but his engineering talent kept him well occupied (and paid), so his racing career was on hold. 
It was 1967 before Howden embarked on a serious season of Formula 3 in his own shiny-new Brabham which had been financed by his engagement as crew chief for Skip Scott and Peter Revson in the 1966 Can-Am series. Howden plugged away in the formula for another two seasons, mixing it with the best, hoping for the big break which was to come in 1970. 
Given the opportunity to compete in F5000, he finished runner-up to Peter Gethin in the championship with a private McLaren M10B, and this success brought an offer to join the BRM team for 1971 as a junior driver. It was a mixed first season, but Howden scored some points at Monza and Watkins Glen, and in non-championship races finished second in the Oulton Park Gold Cup, fourth in the Jochen Rindt Memorial at Hockenheim and fifth in the Race of Champions. Continuing with BRM for 1972, he did not enjoy the best of seasons, again being restricted in the main from using the latest chassis. The high spot of his year came in a different arena, with second place at Le Mans sharing a works Matra with Cevert. 
For 1973 Howden threw in his lot with Frank Williams and the lso-FX3, which was to be a severe disappointment for all concerned, with only a sixth place in Canada salvaging some pride. The season was redeemed a little by his inclusion in the Gulf/John Wyer sports car team, for whom Ganleys best result was second in the Spa 1000 Km in the Mirage with Schuppan. At the beginning of 1974, Ganley was scratching for a drive, and after racing for March in the first two GPs, and taking fifth in the GP Presidente Medici - a Brazilian non-championship race - he unwisely accepted an offer to drive the mysterious F1 Maki, a Japanese dog with no pedigree. The car suffered a suspension failure in practice for the German GP and Ganley was left with serious foot and ankle injuries which ended his Grand Prix career. Howden, who later ran Tiga Cars with Tim Schenken, is currently a board member of the BRDC at Silverstone.";

Richard bought the second seat in the Brabham team for 1974, but when his backing fell through, he lost his place to the well-funded Rikki von Opel. 
A hoped-for second chance with Williams in Sweden later that year failed to materialise when Tom Belso took over the car at the last minute, which left Robarts pretty much in the wilderness until he found the necessary sponsorship to go racing in Formula 2 in 1976 with a year-old March.

317;"Peter   Revson";24;27.2.1939;"Нью-Йорк Сити, Нью-Йорк";;;;;"22.03.1974";"трасса Кьялами, Южная Африка";"Despite his family being a part of the Revlon cosmetics empire, Peter Revson made his way in motor racing very much under his own steam. He was initially regarded rather unfairly as just another American rich-kid playboy after his first unsuccessful attempts at Grand Prix racing, but eventually returned to fulfil his long-held ambition of winning a Grand Prix and, almost as importantly, win the respect and admiration of his peers. 
Peters career started in Hawaii with a Morgan which he shipped back to the States and raced there before trying his hand in a Formula Junior Taraschi. However, the lure of European racing, not to mention European culture, exerted a great pull on the young Revson, who cashed in everything he could to finance his expedition in 1965. Leading the nomadic existence that was so typical of the time, which often meant living out of the transporter, he raced a Formula Junior Cooper on the Continent and won the Copenhagen GP, but soon laid plans for a Formula 1 assault. 
Reg Parnells team had lost their sponsor and took Peter under their wing by way of a semi-works deal. His first tilt at Formula 1 in 1964 brought little cheer except a fourth place at Solitude, and he changed tack in 1965, joining the works Lotus F2 team run for the factory by Ron Harris. A win in the Eifelrennen was lost when he went off on the last lap but he finished second and, dropping into F3, also took the Monaco support race. Despite the seasons progress, the gloss was wearing off Revsons European idyll and he headed back to the States to race a little Brabham BT8 sports car, winning his class at Seattle and Las Vegas. 
For the 1966 season Revson joined Skip Scott in a Ford GT40 and over the next three seasons he began to build his career in big sports cars in Can-Am and Trans-Am before stepping back into single-seaters with a fine drive to fifth at Indianapolis in 1969. The following season he took second at Sebring with actor Steve McQueen in a Porsche 908 and then raced Carl Haass Lola in Can-Am. In 1971 he joined the McLaren team to contest the money-spinning series, winning five rounds in the McLaren M8F, and his performance when taking second place in the Indy 500 for McLaren raised his profile greatly. He was invited to drive for Tyrrell at Watkins Glen in a one-off Grand Prix return before arranging a full season of both Formula 1 and Can-Am with McLaren in 1972. 
The teams F1 M19 wasnt quite a winner, but Peter did a superb job with plenty of placings and few mistakes despite having to miss some races due to clashing USAC commitments. Revson stayed with the team in 1973 and once behind the wheel of the M23 proved a winner at last. His performance in the British GP was exemplary. On a damp track he first grabbed the initiative and then controlled the later stages to score a beautifully judged victory. There was one more win to follow in the rain-soaked confusion of Mosport, but by now internal pressures were afflicting the team, and Peter in particular. 
Emerson Fittipaldi was moving in for 1974 with massive support from Marlboro and Texaco, and Teddy Mayer was willing to run Revson only as a third entry in Yardley colours. Not surprisingly Revson decided to seek better treatment elsewhere, joining the Shadow team. The season started with great promise as the new DN3 showed a fair turn of speed, but in testing for the South African GP at Kyalami tragedy struck when a suspension failure is thought to have caused the car to crash into a guard rail. The Shadow was totally destroyed in the massive impact and Revson had no chance of survival.";

Driving a Lotus 24, he finished seventh on aggregate in the Rand Grand Prix at Kyalami, but an end-over-end shunt in practice for the South African GP a fortnight later saw the car destroyed. Miraculously Paddy emerged shaken but unscathed and returned to motor cycle competition with an AJS/Matchless, on which he finished third in the 1965 500 cc World Championship. 
His career on four wheels really began to take off in 1969 and from then on he enjoyed success in sports cars and single-seaters including a McLaren M10B-Chevrolet and a Team Gunston Lotus 72. Switching to saloon cars with a Mazda, Paddy continued racing into the eighties.";
319;"Tom  Belso";33;27.8.1942;"Копенгаген";;;;;"";"";"Forever being fatuously described as ‘The smiling Dane ill served this hard-working driver. After many years of endeavour he eventually became Denmarks first racing driver to compete in a World Championship Grand Prix and, more importantly, proved himself a formidable competitor in the early seventies in Formula 5000. 
Originally a mechanic, his meticulous preparation was rewarded by the chance to race the Volvo on which he had worked. Tom was a winner first time out and by 1969, driving a Ford Escort, he was the Scandinavian saloon car champion. This success led to a test and subsequent drive in Formula Ford with Hawke in 1970. 
Encouraged by his progress, Belso sold his business interests and moved his family to England to compete in Formula Atlantic in 1971. He finished third in the championship with an old Brabham and then took the leap into Formula 2 for 1972. A fourth place at Albi was the best result in a season strewn with engine problems, but he caught the eye of Jackie Epstein, who signed him for his Shellsport F5000 team - for which he drove splendidly for three seasons. It was during this period that Frank Williams gave Tom his Grand Prix opportunities. Lack of finance curtailed his racing activities for 1976 but, irrepressible as ever, he was back for one more tilt at F5000 in 1977 with John Jordans Lola.";
320;"Brian   Redman";1;9.3.1937;"Коулн, Бернли, Ланкашир";;;;;"";"";"The 1999 season saw the fortieth anniversary of the start of Brians competition career, which began in the modest surroundings of Rufforth with a Morris 1000. Since those far-off days the Lancastrian has probably raced on more of the worlds circuits than most of his peers, but he is hardly a household name. It could have been so different, for Redman had the talent to have become a Grand Prix winner, but his distaste for the high-pressure Formula 1 environment prompted him to turn his back on the GP paddock to enjoy an enormously successful and rewarding career in other forms of racing. 
After early outings with a Mini, Redman made a name for himself in 1965 with a Jaguar E-Type before campaigning a Lola T70 in 1966. His career gradually gained momentum during 1967 in Formula 2 - with David Bridges Lola - and sports car events, Brian winning the Rand 9 Hours in a Mirage with Ickx. In 1968 he had his first taste of Grand Prix racing with Cooper, which ended with a broken arm after a crash at Spa when his cars suspension failed. This came after a run of impressive performances, most notably victories in the BOAC 500 and Spa 1000 Km with Ickx in the GT40 and a brilliant drive in the F2 Eifelrennen with the Ferrari Dino that brought an offer of a works drive, which he declined. 
Redman then began a long period in sports car racing (1969-73) with Porsche and Ferrari, winning virtually all the major classics with the striking exception of Le Mans, which has strangely eluded him. He made occasional returns to Grand Prix racing, usually as a replacement driver, but often without the benefit of testing and preparation. However, by this time Brian had established himself as the man to beat in US F5000, winning three successive titles between 1974 and 1976 in the Haas/Hall Lola. Overcoming serious injuries received at the start of 1977 when his Can-Am Lola flipped, Brian was soon back, winning at Sebring in 1978 and taking the IMSA title in 1981. 
Based in Florida, Redman subsequently graced a wide variety of classes, racing as competitively as ever and revelling in the less-pressured atmosphere of motor sport in North America. He now also fronts the Redman-Bright F3000 team which successfully ran Gonzalo Rodriguez before the Uruguayan drivers tragic death in a CART accident at Laguna Seca in 1999.";

For 1970 Tim and the Sports Motors team took the step up to Formula 2 and had an up-and-down season, the best results being second at Paul Ricard, and third at Pau and Mantorp Park. Schenken also made his Grand Prix debut, coming into a Williams team still reeling from the loss of Piers Courage, but he could do nothing with the de Tomaso. 
The following season he appeared to have made the big breakthrough. Signed as number two to Graham Hill in the Brabham team, Tim was restricted to the old BT33 (possibly an advantage, as it was an easier car to set up than the lobster-claw BT34) but overshadowed the former World Champion for much of the year. Schenkens two points finishes were not really just reward for his efforts, though in non-title races he took third place in the International Trophy and fourth in the Race of Champions. 
In 1972 he made what turned out to be the biggest mistake of his career, joining Team Surtees for a season which effectively sabotaged his long-term Grand Prix ambitions. There was some solace, for he had been leading the Rondel Formula 2 outfit with distinction and was invited to join the Ferrari sports car team, for whom he scored a win in the Buenos Aires 1000 Km and the Nurburgring 1000 Km in addition to four second places, all paired with Peterson. 
After ambitious plans to race a Formula 1 Rondel failed to materialise in 1973 and the Trojan project with his old Brabham boss Ron Tauranac turned into an embarrassing failure in 1974, poor Tim must have thought things couldnt get worse, but they did when he was invited to handle a Lotus 76 in the 1974 US GP and found the car almost undriveable, his one race for the Hethel team ending in non-qualification. 
Schenken then embarked on a programme of sports car and GT racing for George Loos, racing his stable of Porsches during 1975-77 and winning the Nurburgring 1000 Km with Hezemans and Stommelen in 1977. Tim also shared the Jaguar XJ12C with John Fitzpatrick in the 1977 European GT championship, before retiring to concentrate on his Tiga racing car business with partner Howden Ganley.

He jumped straight into F3 the following year with a Lotus and showed much promise, which was realised in 1972 when, driving the Iberia-sponsored works F3 Ensign, he took the Lombard North Central title and was so impressed with Mo Nunn's little team that he commissioned a Formula 1 car to go Grand Prix racing in 1973.
Inevitably with such an inexperienced pairing, success was thin on the ground and von Opel was damned as a playboy racer, which was unfair as he took the whole project very seriously indeed. When the opportunity arose to drive a pukka works Brabham at the beginning of the European season in 1974, Rikki grabbed it, reasoning that he could learn much in this established team.

Over the next few seasons, Larrousse built up a fine reputation in endurance racing, winning the 1971 Sebring 12 Hours and the Nurburgring 1000 Km for Porsche, before enjoying two fabulously successful years with Matra in 1973 and 1974 during which, partnered by Pescarolo, Gerard won Le Mans twice and added further victories at Vallelunga, Dijon, the Osterreichring, Watkins Glen, Imola and Kyalami. In 1974, he was also the European 2-litre champion in an Alpine-Renault and briefly sampled the ambience of Formula 1, but had a miserable time with the poorly prepared rent-a-drive Finotto Brabham. 
In 1975 he undertook a season of Formula 2 with the Elf, winning the Jim Clark Trophy at Hockenheim on aggregate, in addition to a sports car programme for Renault. At the end of the season he was appointed competitions manager at Renault, overseeing the development of their Formula 1 turbo car, and later moved to Ligier before establishing his own team, which competed on minimal budgets and was supported by a motley collection of sponsors from 1987 through to 1994, when the financial climate was such that Larrousse was finally forced to close its doors after a possible merger with French F3000 champions and Grand Prix aspirants DAMS came to nought.";

Between 1971 and 73, Leo swept the board in Interserie racing with a Porsche 917 Spyder entered by AAW-Finland, who also backed his unhappy Grand Prix season in 1974. After this debacle, Kinnunen returned to sports car and GT racing, competing in Porsches for the rest of the decade.";

His career had begun as far back as 1962 with an unreliable Mini Cooper and he then switched to an Anglia, which was similarly troublesome, but Reine plugged away, returning to a Mini in 1965 to take the runner-up position in the Swedish Group 5 championship. Early in 1966 he swapped his saloon for a Cooper F3 car and soon began to show a great deal of flair. By the end of that season he had done well enough to progress to a Brabham bought from his experienced rival Picko Troberg, and he was the man to watch in 1967, comfortably taking the Swedish F3 title, but more importantly making an impression in his occasional appearances in European events. It was now time to spread his wings and compete outside Scandinavia on a regular basis. He travelled down to Bologna with Ronnie Peterson and the two Swedes each ordered themselves a new F3 Tecno for the 1968 season. Reine gained valuable experience racing abroad that year and scored 11 wins in total, while his younger rival concentrated on racing at home and took the Swedish crown. 
In 1969 Wisell took up an offer to race F3 and GT cars for Chevron, but generally endured a disappointing time. Feeling that he now needed to find a more challenging arena, Reine was persuaded to join Jo Bonniers sports car team in 1970, and also took over the Sid Taylor F5000 McLaren with great success, winning three of the final four rounds towards the end of the year. Of course, by then his big chance had arrived, his performance and that of Emerson Fittipaldi ensuring their places in the Lotus team for 1971. It was to be a hectic year for the Swede, who did a full Formula 2 programme highlighted by a splendid win in the Pau GP. His performances in Formula 1 were solid but not inspired, and Chapman decided to promote his then current hot-shot Dave Walker into the team for 1972. 
Wisell moved to BRM who were running a multi-car squad which spread the available resources too thinly. Nothing worthwhile was achieved and Reine even made a brief return to the Lotus fold in place of the luckless Walker for the Canadian GP. Wisell, no longer considered to have sufficient Grand Prix potential, drifted into other forms of the sport. His superb win in the F2 Eifelrennen was a timely reminder of the talent that still lurked, but his subsequent occasional Grand Prix appearances brought no joy.

He was regarded as something of a playboy racer in his early days. Certainly his 1972 Formula 2 season with a March was undistinguished and in his only F2 race the following year, the Rouen GP, where he drove for Team Surtees, he crashed on the warm-up lap after finishing third in his qualifying heat. 
No doubt bringing much-needed finance, he raced for Surtees in both Grands Prix and Formula 2 in 1974, but his career was then interrupted by a neck injury sustained while skiing early in 1975. Jose continued to race in F2 -firstly with Fred Operts Chevron in 1976 and later with Kauhsen and ACS cars - on and off without success until 1979.

After an early start in a Lotus Seven in 1962, Peter soon became one of the countrys top club sports car drivers in his Lotus 23. He then moved into Formula 3 in 1965 with Charles Lucas, but his career really stood still until 1968 when he ran a full Formula 2 season with Frank Lythgoe, finishing strongly with a brilliant second at Albi and a third at Vallelunga after a Brabham had been acquired to replace a disappointing Chevron. 
It was the introduction of F5000 in 1969 that really put Peters career on the map. In a semi-works McLaren, he dominated the early part of the season with four straight wins and then defended his advantage grimly as his championship lead was whittled away. The final round ended in anti-climax with a collision but the title went to Gethin, and he proved himself a more than worthy champion by retaining the crown convincingly the following year. By this time he was closely involved with the McLaren Grand Prix effort; having made a promising debut to finish sixth in the Race of Champions, he was brought into the team after the sad loss of Bruce McLaren in a testing accident at Goodwood and also took over the vacant Can-Am drive, winning a round at Elkhart Lake. 
Staying with the team for 1971, Peter inexplicably continued to struggle in Grands Prix, though he did finish second on aggregate in the International Trophy, but it was something of a surprise when he moved to BRM. Almost immediately he won at Monza and then repeated that triumph in the tragically shortened Victory Race at Brands Hatch, in which team-mate Jo Siffert perished. 
Hopes were high for 1972, but Peter endured a thin time of it with BRM, though an equally low-key season in Formula 2 with Chevron did bring an unexpected win in the Pau GP. So it was back to F5000 at home and abroad, which yielded a shock win in the Race of Champions. Gethin made a couple more Grand Prix appearances, but concentrated on F5000 with Chevron and VDS, and also raced in the newly revived Can-Am series before retiring at the end of 1977.

329;"Derek Bell";1;31.10.1941;"Пиннер, Мидлсекс";;;;;"";"";"It seems incomprehensible that a driver as talented as Derek Bell has only started in nine World Championship Grands Prix. He seemed to be jinxed when it came to Formula 1 - always in the wrong car at the wrong time - and eventually he was passed over in favour of younger talent. 
Tentatively entering the sport with a Lotus Seven in 1964, Bell soon moved into Formula 3, initially with a Lotus which was run - with the support of his step-father Colonel Hender - under the Church Farm Racing banner. It proved to be a character-building couple of years for Bell, who realised that he needed the help of wiser and more experienced heads if his career was to progress. He therefore decided to team up with Peter Westbury, which got his career onto a stable footing and brought results as well. 
Despite a lack of funds, Bell and his step-father financed a season of Formula 2 in 1968 with a Brabham BT23, which brought him to the attention of Ferrari, who offered him a drive midway through the season. His debut for the Scuderia started badly with Derek in the midst of a huge pile-up in the F2 Monza Lottery GP. Fortunately he was exonerated from blame and looked set to win at Zandvoort until his gearbox failed. Bell tasted Grand Prix racing in the scarlet cars and enjoyed a trip down-under to contest the Tasman championship. Unfortunately for Derek, Ferrari withdrew from the bulk of their programme in mid-1969, leaving him without a drive apart from a one-off outing in the 4WD McLaren. To the rescue came Tom Wheatcroft, who, after financing a disastrous foray to the Tasman series, sponsored Derek for a full Formula 2 season in 1970, Clay Regazzoni just pipping him to the title. He was also invited by Jacques Swaters to drive a Ferrari 512 in the Spa 1000 Km - a race which was to lay the foundations of his future sports car success - and scored his only World Championship point with an appearance for Team Surtees at Watkins Glen. For 1971 Derek was paired with Jo Siffert in the Gulf/John Wyer Porsche as the team took the sports car championship. Derek stayed with Gulf/Wyer through the next three years, proving his worth as a top-drawer sports car driver while his miscellaneous Grand Prix appearances with Tecno and Surtees proved forgettable. 
The 1975 season brought the first of his five Le Mans victories with Jacky Ickx in the Gulf and a successful championship campaign for Alfa Romeo - winning three times with Pescarolo - in the T33. The next few seasons saw a globe-trotting Derek competing in F5000, G8, touring cars, Formula Atlantic, World Championship of Makes events, etc. before joining the Rothmans Porsche factory squad which was to dominate sports car racing in the eighties (Derek taking the drivers championship - with Hans Stuck - in 1985 and 1986). In recognition of his many fine performances Bell was awarded the MBE in 1986. The nineties found Derek enjoying the cut and thrust of racing in IMSA. With a Nissan GTP he took a splendid second place in the 1993 Sebring 12 Hours and finished fourth in the GTP championship standings. 
After finishing sixth in the 1994 Le Mans 24 Hours, Derek announced he had driven in the French classic for the last time. But as he began his 32nd year in motor sport, the urge to race was still there. At Sebring he shared the second-place Spice-Chevrolet with Andy Wallace and Jan Lammers and, contrary to his earlier intentions, he was persuaded back to the Sarthe circuit once again, tempted by the chance of sharing a McLaren GTR with his son Justin and Wallace, the trio finishing a fine third overall.

330;"David   Hobbs";1;9.6.1939;"Лемингтон-Спа, Уорикшир";;;;;"";"";"With only the occasional foray into Grand Prix racing, Hobbs forged a very satisfying career for himself over three decades, starting in the early 1960s with Lotus and Jaguar sports cars before graduating to Formula Junior, Formula 2 and then big-banger sports cars with the Lola T70 in 1965. 
His first Formula 1 break came with Bernard Whites BRM, in which he finished third in the 1966 Syracuse GP, and this led to a season of F2 with Team Surtees in 1967, before he fully established himself in the top league of sports car racing with the John Wyer team in 1968 by winning the Monza 1000 Km in a Ford GT40. 
The advent of F5000/Formula A in 1969 was to provide a profitable furrow for David to plough over the next few seasons, particularly with Carl Hogans Lola in the States, where he was to base himself more and more. In 1974 he finished fifth in the Indianapolis 500 with a McLaren, and later in the season he deputised for the injured Mike Hailwood in a couple of Grands Prix. The sheer variety of cars that Hobbs drove throughout a career that encompassed F1, F2, endurance, Can-Am, F5000, touring cars, IMSA and much more is simply bewildering. Into the nineties David still raced occasionally, before concentrating on his role as a TV commentator for Speedvision in America, which he performed with all the characteristic professionalism one would expect from this seasoned racer.";

Dieter really came to prominence by winning the Austrian touring car championship in a BMW 1800 in 1966, and his sideways driving style in the factory BMW then took him to two consecutive European touring car titles in 1968-69. He was also part of BMWs largely unsuccessful Formula 2 programme, though he did manage a victory at Hockenheim at the end of 1970. Quester switched to a March for a season of Formula 2 in 1971, and performed well, winning the Lottery GP and scoring five second places. It was around this period that, frustrated at being unable to get a Formula 1 ride, he more than once seriously considered retirement, but he carried on and eventually drove a rented Surtees in the 1974 Austrian GP. 
Subsequently concentrating on sports cars and saloons, he was European G2 touring car champion in 1977 and a regular in the BMW Procar series of 1979-80, while throughout the nineties he has been a permanent fixture in BMW touring cars in the European, German and Austrian championships, as well as competing in a BMW M5 in the IMSA GT3 class in America in 1996 and 1997.";

He was to spend the bulk of his short career trapped, albeit tremendously successfully, in Formula Vee and Super Vee, with only occasional outings in Formula Ford offering a glimpse of his natural talent on a wider stage. 
Without the backing to race in Formula 2, Koinigg nonetheless found himself in demand by the Ford Cologne team, and he also handled Martini Racings G5 Porsche before raising the finance to hire a private Brabham for the 1974 Austrian GP.

In 1967 he hired the third works Lotus to race alongside Clark (pictured left) and Hill in the first World Championship Canadian GP. Switching to single-seaters, he was Canadian FA champion with a Lola T142 in 1969, and again the following year, this time with a McLaren M10.

335;"Francois  Cevert";10;25.2.1944;"Париж";;;;;"06.10.1973";"трасса Уоткинс-Глен, Нью-Йорк, США";"Ceverts immense natural talent had been nurtured and developed over a four-year period in the Tyrrell team. He had been given what amounted to a personal master-class in the art of Grand Prix racing by Jackie Stewart and learned so well that at the time of his shocking death at Watkins Glen in 1975 he was the finished article, ready to assume the mantle of a champion after his team leaders impending retirement. 
A Volant Shell award had seen Francois begin his racing career in 1967 at the wheel of his prize, an F3 Alpine. The season was something of a disaster, with the old car proving very unreliable. Undismayed by this, he bought a Tecno for the following year and, after getting to grips with its inherent understeer, went on to take the French FB championship. So impressed were the Italian manufacturers that they offered Cevert a place in their Formula 2 team for 1969, and despite his lack of experience he took third place in the championship and a win in the Trophees de France meeting at Reims. Francois also made his Grand Prix debut in the car in the Formula 2 class of the German GP. 
For 1970 he planned another season with Tecno as well as finally accepting an offer to drive for Matra in sports cars, which came via his brother-in-law Jean-Pierre Beltoise. But when Johnny Servoz-Gavin suddenly retired in mid-season, Cevert took over the Tyrrell drive and his perspective had suddenly changed. Playing himself in sensibly with the March 701, the Frenchman scored a satisfying sixth place at Monza, but he really blossomed in 1971 with the superb Tyrrell, taking two excellent second places behind his leader at Paul Ricard and the Nurburgring before posting his first (and only) Grand Prix win in the US GP. 
The 1972 Formula 1 season was more difficult, perhaps not helped by Stewarts illness, and Cevert finished in the points on only three occasions. He also drove quite regularly in other formulae, dovetailing appearances in John Coombs Elf-backed March in F2 with a full Can-Am programme (which saw a win at Donnybrooke) and a one-off drive at Le Mans, where he took a splendid second place for Matra with Howden Ganley. Tyrrell were back at their best in 1973. Stewart, already intending to retire after one last season, used all his considerable gifts to take a third World Championship with Francois right behind him, the apprentice having matured to the point that he could now be the faster man on occasion. Certainly it was felt that Cevert could have taken the German GP if he had so chosen, but in the event he had to be content with no fewer than five second-place finishes before that fateful day at Watkins Glen in October when, attempting to take pole position, he lost control of his car on a bumpy part of the track, the Tyrrell being hurled into the barriers with such ferocity that Francois stood no chance of survival. Frances most likely World Champion was gone, and Ken Tyrrell had lost the man who could perhaps have kept his team at the pinnacle in the post-Stewart era.";
336;"Jackie Stewart";1;11.6.1939;"Милтон, Дамбартоншир, Шотландия";;;;;"";"";"Jackie Stewart was the driving force behind the transformation of motor racing from a sport where death was almost routine. When Stewart began racing, the risks were blithely accepted with a shrug of the shoulders as an occupational hazard. But the determined little Scot who was to see many of his friends and colleagues perish, pursued his campaign with remarkable fervour long after his own retirement and he more than any other individual is responsible for the emergence of the highly organised and remarkably safe sport we know today. As if this werent enough, Stewart was also a truly great racing driver, a triple World Champion who was a more than worthy successor to his great idol Jim Clark. 
Motor racing was part of the family as the young Jackie was growing up, for his brother Jimmy - eight years his senior - was a driver for Ecurie Ecosse. However, young Jackie was more interested in clay pigeon shooting. He was an excellent shot, winning many tournaments at home and abroad, and was hoping to take part in the 1960 Rome Olympics, but missed the team when he had an off day at the final trials. It was to be the biggest disappointment of his sporting life, worse than anything that he ever suffered during his racing days. Jackies circuit career began in a casual way, at the wheel of a Healey Sprite and a Marcos, before he joined Ecurie Ecosse in 1963. Driving the teams GT and touring cars, Stewart virtually swept the board. While still racing for Ecosse, Jackie came under the guidance of Ken Tyrrell to race a Cooper-BMC in Formula 3, where he set about thrashing the opposition. Colin Chapman tried him in his Ron Harris Formula 2 team and liked what he saw, putting the Scot into a Formula 1 Lotus for the Rand GP at Kyalami, where he retired in the first heat but won the second. 
Offered a seat alongside Jim Clark for 1965, Stewart wisely declined, preferring to join BRM, where he could learn his trade with Graham Hill and not face the pressure of being compared directly with his fellow Scot. A second place in the Race of Champions and a win in the International Trophy gave fair notice that here was a special talent, and his Grand Prix performances went from strength to strength, culminating in his first World Championship win at Monza. In the 1966 Tasman series Stewart took the BRM to four victories, and he then -won the opening Grand Prix of the year at Monaco in the 2-litre car. Then his luck changed. Victory seemed certain at the Indianapolis 500 until an engine failure close to the finish, and on his return to Europe he crashed the BRM in a rainstorm at Spa. Lying trapped in the car for some time soaked in petrol with a cracked collar-bone was an experience that the Scot would never forget and no doubt acted as a catalyst for his subsequent safety crusade. 
Jackie stayed with BRM for a third season in 1967, but it was a disappointing year with the H16 car proving woefully unreliable. His second place with it in Belgium was a remarkable achievement, especially as he was obliged to hold it in gear for much of the race. The only compensation was a drive for Ferrari in the BOAC 500 at Brands Hatch, where he shared a P4 with Chris Amon, the pair taking second place and clinching the championship for Maranello. Of more importance, however, was his developing working partnership with Ken Tyrrell and Matra, Jackie taking the French Formula 2 car to victory in four of the last five races of the season as a prelude to a Formula 1 effort in 1968. 
At last Stewart was in a competitive car, and following the death of Jim Clark he looked the favourite to take the title. Unfortunately his season was interrupted by a crash in a Formula 2 race which sidelined him with a wrist injury. Though he missed only two Grands Prix, it was enough to crucially blunt his title challenge. A feature of the year was his brilliant win in the German GP in the most appalling conditions, truly one of his greatest drives, and there was no stopping him in 1969 as he swept to his first championship with six Grand Prix wins in the Matra MS80, a car he loved to drive. 
For the 1970 season Tyrrell was forced to resort to a March chassis, for Matra were running their own operation once more. However, despite a promising start with wins in the Race of Champions and the Spanish GP and a second place in the International Trophy, all was not well. The car was not up to the expectations of a World Champion, and therefore not of the required standard, and Tyrrell secretly set Derek Gardner to work building his own Grand Prix challenger at the greatest possible speed. The new car was unveiled at the Canadian GP where Stewart took pole position. The future was now clear and Tyrrell was henceforth to build his own cars. The 1971 season saw Jackie back at his brilliant best, using the new Tyrrell to devastating effect, winning six Grands Prix and easily taking his second World Championship. He was much in demand that year and undertook the ten-round Can-Am series for Carl Haas. Stewart won two rounds in the Lola, but the strain of trans-Atlantic travel was already taking its toll. 
Jackies health was to suffer in 1972 due to an ulcer which caused him to miss six weeks of the season, enough to see his title chances disappear as an ebullient Emerson Fittipaldi made the most of his opportunities with his Lotus 72. Not that Stewart was about to let his title slip away without a fight. He won the French GP on his return and finished the year on a winning note with back-to-back wins at Mosport and Watkins Glen to sound a warning that he would not be so easy to beat in 1973. And so it was to prove. By this time Stewart was the complete driver, mentally and physically prepared to cope with every eventuality. He won as he pleased at Kyalami, Monte Carlo, Zandvoort and the Nurburgring, thus passing the late Jim darks number of wins to set a new record total of 27. His last race in Europe was one of his greatest. As he climbed through the field after a puncture at Monza to take fourth place, it was a stirring sight to see him forced to drive at the limit lap after lap, picking off one car after another. 
Jackie had decided to retire after the US GP at Watkins Glen and what would have been his 100th Grand Prix start, but the weekend was to be clouded by tragedy as his team-mate Francois Cevert was killed in practice. The Tyrrell team withdrew their cars, and the wonderful career of John Young Stewart was over. Since then, of course, Jackie has worked harder than ever. He was seen regularly at the circuits, imparting his wisdom to a new generation of racers, and his son Paul, much against his parents wishes, raced with some success, before setting up his own team, Paul Stewart Racing. The near-dominance of the operation in the junior formulae during the early nineties led to an ambitious move into Formula 1 in 1997. With a five-year engine deal from Ford, and Jackies business acumen and vast experience, Stewart Grand Prix was clearly going to be a force to be reckoned with. Having the necessary funding to compete properly was a crucial factor in persuading Stewart to take the plunge. A second-place finish at Monaco in the organisations first season was an early peak, to be followed by the inevitable troughs as the young team found their feet in the white-hot cauldron of Formula 1. 
Without doubt, 1999 was a momentous year for Jackie, who reached his 60th birthday, saw Stewart Grand Prix achieve their maiden victory at the European Grand Prix, and took the decision to sell the Formula 1 team he had built up to Ford. Henceforth the organisation will race under the Jaguar banner, but Stewart maintains that the single victory he achieved as a constructor means more to him than any of the 27 wins he took when he was a driver.";

He had occasional chances to drive their front-engined Gemini car, but only when he struck out on his own - at the comparatively late age of 24 -with a Brabham F3 in club and Libre events did his racing career start in earnest. 
With the backing of stockbroker colleagues Ralph Clarke and David Mordaunt -which was to be so vital to his progress to Formula 1 - Beuttler moved into F3 for 1969 with encouraging results given the calibre of opposition. Staying with the class for another season, Mike won three high-profile events, at Silverstone, Brands Hatch and Montlhery, gaining third place in the Shellsport F3 championship and second place in that years Grovewood Awards for his efforts. 
For 1971 ambitious plans were laid to race a March 712. Alistair Guthrie joined the roster of backers and with the factory overseeing his efforts, Mike undertook a full European F2 series. However, it was to prove a bitter disappointment, with the car beset by sundry maladies until the last round when he won the Madunina GP at Vallelunga. March had also helped him into Formula 1, without any great success. 
It was the same recipe for 1972, with the addition of another backer - Jack Durlacher - to help pay the bills but no worthwhile results in Grands Prix. The most interesting aspect of the season, in fact, was the teams decision to adapt their 722 F2 car to accept the Cosworth engine. So much better was this machines handling than that of the notorious 721X that the full-works cars were quickly consigned to history and Peterson and Lauda found themselves the beneficiaries. 
Beuttler and his partners gave it one more shot in 1973, starting the season with the old car, but he was no more competitive when the new March 731 finally arrived. Mike called it quits and, after a single outing in the Brands Hatch 1000 Km in 1974, turned his back on racing and went into business. He later moved to San Francisco, where he died at the tragically young age of 45.";

He had sensed that his family would be opposed to his early racing activities, and ran under the pseudonym Nanni, which stuck. He bought a Mini-Cooper with which he entered the 1965 Italian touring car championship and proceeded to take ten class wins in ten starts, before moving on to an Alfa Romeo GTA. 
Galli began to forge a reputation in sports car racing in the factory Alfa Romeo T33 in 1967, though he had to wait until the following season for success, winning the Circuit of Mugello (with Bianchi and Vaccarella), and finishing second in both the Targa Florio and the Imola 500 Km (both with Giunti). He was to be a mainstay of the Autodelta sports car programme right through until 1972, with many placings in the top six. 
In tandem with his long-distance activities, Galli moved into single-seaters, initially with Tecno in Formula 2. He then graduated to Grand Prix racing via an Alfa Romeo engine-supply deal, first at Monza in 1970 with McLaren, and then with March in 1971. For 1972, he became involved in the well-funded but unsuccessful Tecno F1 project, his best result being a third place in the poorly supported GP of the Italian Republic at Vallelunga. With Clay Regazzoni indisposed, Galli was invited to represent Ferrari in the French GP, but could finish no better than 13th.

At first things went well, but as the season wore on he slipped further down the grid, and by the end of the year his Grand Prix tenure was over. 
He started racing in 1960, but it was 1964-65 before he began competing seriously, becoming USRRC champion in the under-2-litre class with six wins in nine races in a Lotus-Porsche sports car. This led to an invitation to race a works Porsche 904 in the 1966 Sebring 12-hour race, in which Follmer finished seventh with Kolb, winning the under-2-litre class. 
Still a part-time racer and full-time insurance broker, George financed his own Lola-Chevrolet for 1967 to race in USRRC events, but the car repeatedly broke down, and when Roger Penske offered him a Can-Am ride late in the season Follmer accepted, taking two third places and a sixth in his three races. The die was cast.

Despite a victorious comeback with the works Ferrari Dino T166 which saw him win two races and the championship in the South American Formula 2 Temporada series, the Italian's big chance had gone.
Undaunted, he busied himself in the newly inaugurated F5000/FA series for Team Surtees on both sides of the Atlantic before returning to F1 in 1970, initially with backing from Alfa Romeo, racing their engine in a variety of ‘third' works cars.

Roger had a successful karting career behind him when, with encouragement from his father, he took up circuit racing in an 850 Mini, winning 14 races in 1968. Deciding to try single-seaters, he purchased a Cooper T71, which was unfortunately burnt out in a garage fire. However, Roger took the engine and fitted it to a Ford Anglia and it proved to be a potent combination. In 1970 he won the 1000 cc class of the Hepolite Glazier championship with ease, and decided to try Formula 3 the following year. Despite his inexperience, he was soon a front-runner, with his spectacular driving in a March 713 catching the eye. He was fortunate at this time to be helped financially by local businessman and racing enthusiast Tom Wheatcroft, and the pair became firm friends, with Tom guiding his rise towards the top. 
Having won the Lombank F3 championships Williamson stayed in the formula for a further year and convincingly took both the major F3 titles that season. His foray into Formula 2 was not so happy, but it was good experience for a planned season in 1973 with GRD. The car turned out to be no match for the dominant March chassis, and Wheatcroft swiftly provided his charge with the equipment he needed. Almost immediately Roger won the Lottery GP at Monza, and would have taken another victory at Misano but for engine problems, establishing himself as a truly serious talent. A season in Formula 1 was the goal in 1974, and to this end Wheatcroft hired an STP March for a couple of races to allow Williamson to become acclimatised. At Silverstone he was eliminated in the now notorious Jody Scheckter-induced carnage, and then came Zandvoort. It is thought a tyre failed, sending his car into an inadequately secured barrier which launched it across the track. The March came to rest upside down and on fire, with poor Roger trapped in the cockpit. Scandalously, nobody came to his help, apart from the brave David Purley, who single-handedly attempted to right the inverted machine.

By this time he had made a solid start to his Grand Prix career, his initial hire-drive agreement with BRM proving so satisfactory that he soon became a full team member. 
For the 1972 season Marko had a BRM contract for Formula 1, and a seat in the Alfa Romeo sports car team, for whom he scored second places in both the Targa Florio and the Osterreichring 1000 Km and thirds at Daytona and in the Nurburgring 1000 Km.

Set to race for GRD in Formula 2 in 1973, Dave suffered two separate road accidents, breaking a leg in one and an arm in the other, but came back to race in 2-litre sports car events. He then had a brief stab at F5000 in 1975, before trying his hand at Canadian Formula Atlantic.";

He won his first event, a hill-climb, in 1960, and continued to race in his own country, usually with a Porsche, until he joined the European Formula 2 circus in 1967 for his first sustained attempt at professional racing. His season with the Lola was not too successful, so in 1968 he switched to sports car and GT racing, winning the Jarama 6 Hours with Rindt, and finishing fourth in the Sebring 12 Hours with Lins, both in Porsches. Alex finished second in the Buenos Aires 1000 Km in 1970 with his Porsche 908, again teamed with Rindt and cleaned up in Spanish G5/6 races with his Porsche 917. 
After failing to qualify for a Grand Prix in three attempts with Lotus, Soler-Roig joined March for the 1971 season, but although he made the grids he felt dissatisfied with the engines he was given and quit in mid-season, preferring to concentrate on his drive in the European touring car championship with Ford Germany, which yielded two victories in the Capri, co-driving with Glemser. His short spell in the Marlboro BRM team at the beginning of 1972 was a disaster, but a return to touring cars brought further wins at Zandvoort and Jarama with the help of such talents as Glemser, Mass and Larrousse before Alex called it a day at the end of the season.";
348;"John Love";48;7.12.1924;"Булавайо";;;;;"";"";"John Love was well known in Europe, having ventured to England in 1961 to race Ken Tyrrells Formula Junior Cooper along with Tony Maggs. Although in his late thirties, Love was back for more in 1962, driving the works Mini-Cooper with spectacular success as well as competing in Formula Junior, but his season was cut short by an accident at Albi in which he sustained a badly broken arm. Business interests kept him at home from then onwards, apart from an abortive trip to the 1964 Italian GP, when his works Cooper was ill prepared. 
The first of Loves six South African championships came in 1964, and it was a tally that was only halted by a determined rival in Dave Charlton, with whom he had some ding-dong battles over the years. Success generally eluded John in the local World Championship Grands Prix, though, with the exception of the 1967 event, when only a late pit stop for fuel prevented him taking what would have been a fairy-tale victory. 
In addition to his single-seater exploits in South Africa, Love also regularly raced sports cars with distinction in the Springbok series of the late sixties and early seventies.";
349;"John Surtees";1;11.2.1934;"Татсфилд, Суррей";;;;;"";"";"John Surtees is widely honoured as the only World Champion on two wheels and four, a remarkable achievement of which he can justly be proud. But that tag tends to be used so often that it is easy to forget what a brilliant all-round racing driver he really was. Born into a motor cycling background - his father Jack was an amateur racer - the young Surtees began racing on two wheels seriously in 1951, becoming a star on Nortons through to the mid-fifties when he switched to the Italian MV Agusta concern. From 1956 to 1960 Surtees was the outstanding rider of the day, winning seven world titles in the 350 cc and 500 cc classes. He had some promising trials with both Vanwall and Aston Martin in 1959 and, when his bike commitments allowed, embarked on his car racing career early in 1960. 
A win first time out at Goodwood in Ken Tyrrells Cooper Formula Junior marked him down as a special talent. No sooner had he purchased his own F2 Cooper than he received an invitation from Lotus to race their Formula 1 Lotus 18. At this point Colin Chapman was adroitly juggling with a number of drivers, a situation of which John was unaware. Nevertheless he proved staggeringly quick for one so inexperienced. In his second Grand Prix he was second only to Brabham, and he led in Portugal before an error cost him dear. Not so worldly-wise in those early days, John shied away from signing to drive alongside Jim Clark for the 1961 season, unhappy with Chapmans somewhat cavalier attitude towards his contract with Innes Ireland. In the short term at least, it proved to be the wrong decision. Joining the Yeoman Credit-backed team running off-the-shelf Coopers for 1961, Surtees recorded only mediocre results, the sole minor success being a win in the Glover Trophy. Things improved when the team, now under the Bowmaker banner, aligned themselves with Lola, and Surtees, deeply involved in the development of the car, came close to a Grand Prix victory. He did win a non-title race at Mallory Park, but at the end of the year could resist the overtures of Ferrari no longer. 
John had a galvanising effect on the team, not only as a driver but also as a source of technical input, particularly in the development of the monocoque chassis. Prior to his arrival at Maranello, Ferrari had completely lost their way but by mid-1963 Surtees had won both the German GP and Mediterranean GP to re-establish the Scuderia as a potent force once more. When the team introduced the 158 V8 engine early in 1964, Surtees at last found the car in which he could make a realistic championship bid. Mid-season victories in Germany and Italy enabled him to travel to the final round in Mexico with a chance of the title, and luck was on his side as his two rivals, Clark and Hill, both hit trouble. It may not have been one of the most convincing championship wins, but in a year when all the cars were evenly matched it was still thoroughly deserved. 
The 1965 season found Ferrari bogged down with their flat-12 engine project, and most of Surtees success came in the older 158 V8 at the beginning of the season. Apart from his sports car commitments, which brought victory in the Nurburgring 1000 Km, John was now running his own Lola T70 on the North American sports car scene, but in practice for a race at Mosport he suffered a massive accident which he was very lucky to survive - as it was he lay in hospital with serious back injuries for many weeks before making a brave comeback the following spring. Ironically 1966 was probably his finest year despite the bitter disagreement which caused him to leave Ferrari in mid-term. Before the split, John had won the Belgian GP, the Syracuse GP and the Monza 1000 Km sports car race, but afterwards he scored victories in the Mexican GP for Cooper and a whole succession of sports car races back in his Lola. 
The 1967 season was another busy one. Surtees joined the Honda F1 effort but development proved to be a slow and painful process, though some reward came when the hastily prepared Lola-based Hondola won a sensational Italian GP by a hairs-breadth from Jack Brabham. Johns involvement with Lola was deep. Running their Formula 2 car, he broke the Brabham dominance on occasion, which was a not inconsiderable feat, but the Lola-Aston Martin sports car project was best forgotten. Meanwhile his transatlantic journeys to bag some of the lucrative purse-money on offer in Can-Am went on unhindered. With little headway being made during the second year of the Surtees-Honda alliance, the project was abandoned at the end of the season, and for 1969 John joined BRM but it was to become a nightmarish season for both parties. His Can-Am drives for Chaparral that year were also less than satisfactory when the narrow 2H car proved to be the most difficult machine he had ever handled. 
The logical decision was to follow the example of his fellow drivers Brabham and McLaren and build his own Formula 1 car. He was obliged to run a McLaren while his own challenger was being prepared, but a superb drive and fastest lap in South Africa proved he could still cut it behind the wheel. There was even a brief and successful return to Ferrari for three sports car races, before development of the Surtees TS7 took over, an aggregate win in the end-of-season Gold Cup race at Oulton Park boosting his morale. The 1971 season proved tougher than expected as the new TS9 made only an occasional impression on the Grand Prix elite. In the less rarefied atmosphere of non-championship races, John scored some useful placings, again winning the Gold Cup, but there was no denying it had been a disappointing season for a man who had been used to much greater things. 
Mike Hailwoods drive at Monza, coupled with a realisation that he could no longer fulfil all the roles in his team effectively, saw Surtees take a back seat in 1972. His third place in the International Trophy was his last Formula 1 success, while in Formula 2 he signed off his racing career with wins in the Japanese GP at Mount Fuji and the Shell GP at Imola. Thenceforth he concentrated on running his team, with a succession of drivers good, bad and indifferent filling the cockpit depending on the exigencies of the times. 
Certainly few of them could meet the exacting standards required by this hardest of taskmasters. When suitable sponsorship dried up and medical problems which had dogged him intermittently as a result of his 1965 Mosport accident resurfaced, he quit the racing scene somewhat disillusioned. Happily, having remarried and become a contented family man, John now enjoys the historic racing scene in both cars and bikes, where he is a major attraction demonstrating many of the machines he handled with such brilliance in the past.";

Before shipping the new car back, however, he tackled a few Grands Prix - keeping out of the way - as well as the non-championship Jochen Rindt Memorial Trophy at Hockenheim, in which he managed a worthy sixth place. 
Back in America, Barber enjoyed some success in Formula A with the car in 1972 before switching to GT machinery. Since his retirement from racing he has built up one of the worlds leading racing schools and, in conjunction with Saab, instigated the very successful single-seater Pro Series - now known as the Barber-Dodge Pro Series in deference to its engine supplier.";

After a brief tilt at USAC, during the course of which he finished fifth at both Indianapolis and Pocono with an Eagle-Offy in 1972, and sixth at Ontario in 1973, Sam raced the Norris Industries Talon in US F5000 in 1974 and briefly in 1976 until his sponsorship dried up. 
Thereafter he focused his attentions on IMSA and was a Le Mans regular for many years. Racing a works 3.5-litre BMW CSL, he won the 1975 Sebring 12-hour race with Redman, Stuck and Moffat.

353;"Pedro Rodriguez";25;18.1.1940;"Мехико";;;;;"11.07.1971";"трасса Норисринг, Германия";"Pedro Rodriguez looked just great in a late-sixties Grand Prix car. His head seemed perpetually laid right back, and you could clearly see his eyes staring through the big aviator goggles as he went about his work. Aesthetics aside, that his talent went largely unregarded in Formula 1 is something of a mystery, and it was only right at the end of his life that his legend was forged. 
Two years older than his brother Ricardo, Pedro was racing bikes by the age of 12 and a Jaguar XK120 by the time he was 15. He was soon joined by his sibling and the pair became notorious for their daring exploits in the late fifties. Attracting the attention of Luigi Chinetti, Pedro began racing his NART Ferraris, taking second place in the 1958 Nassau Trophy. The brothers eventually came to Europe and set about building a brilliant reputation in Chinettis Ferraris, winning both the Nurburgring and Paris 1000 Km in 1961. 
The death of Ricardo in Mexico at the end of 1962 was a devasting blow for Pedro, who nevertheless carried on racing, but was largely restricted to North America during 1963 and 1964. There were wins at Daytona in the GT class in 1963, and outright in 1964, sharing a GTO with Phil Hill. There were also end-of-year F1 drives for Lotus and Ferrari, but no offers of permanent Grand Prix employment came his way, so the little Mexican stuck it out in sports car racing, taking the occasional single-seater opportunities he was given. For the 1967 South African GP, Pedro was offered a works Cooper drive, but no deal beyond that. In a race of high attrition, he drove steadily to score a surprise win, a feat which eluded even Rindt during his spell with the team. Rodriguez was naturally then taken on for the rest of the year, but the car was rapidly becoming uncompetitive, and he did well just to scrape the odd point thereafter. His season was also interrupted by injury when an accident at Enna in the F2 Protos left him with a broken foot. 
Pedro joined BRM in 1968 and, after an unsuccessful Tasman series, started the season in fine form, taking a memorable second place in the Race of Champions when he sliced through the field after being left at the start. After a rather lucky second place at Spa, the season slid into mediocrity as the team lost their way, and it was Pedro who paid the price, making way for John Surtees in 1969. As luck would have it, that was to be a terrible year at Bourne, and Pedro was fortunate to be out of the firing line, racing Tim Parnells semi-works machine until he accepted an offer to drive the equally disappointing Ferrari. 
Rodriguez had become much in demand as a sports car driver following his 1968 Le Mans victory with Bianchi in John Wyers Ford GT40. He drove for both Ferrari and Matra the following year, before returning to Wyer in 1970. He was also back at BRM, and this time they had come up with a really good car in the P153. There were two races that year which Pedro would leave as a legacy to the portfolio of great motor racing performances. At Brands Hatch, driving the fearsome Gulf Porsche 917, he produced an unforgettable display in the rain to win the 1000 Km by a five-lap margin, and then in the Belgian GP at Spa he drove a masterful race, almost to the point of perfection, to beat Amons March. He would score no more Grand Prix victories, only a win in the 1971 Rothmans Trophy at Oulton Park, but he continued to drive the Porsche with a fearlessness that was frightening. In 1971 Rodriguez won the Daytona 24 Hours, Monza 1000 Km and Spa 1000 Km with Jack Oliver, and the Osterreichring 1000 Km with Richard Attwood to confirm his position as sports car racings leading exponent. 
Pedro lived for racing, and could not refuse the offer of a drive in an Interserie round at Norisring. Driving Herbert Mullers Ferrari 512M, Rodriguez crashed heavily when a tyre was thought to have deflated. The car burst into flames and when the driver was finally released he was found to have succumbed to multiple injuries.";
354;"Jo Siffert";11;7.7.1936;"Фрибур";;;;;"24.10.1971";"трасса Брендс-Хетч, Кент, Англия";"Siffert could be a wild and hairy driver, but how the fans loved him, perhaps because he was a man who chanced his arm a little more than most. Chiefly remembered for the 1968 British Grand Prix when, in Rob Walkers dark-blue Lotus 49, he withstood all Chris Amons attempts to pass in the Ferrari to take a fairy-tale victory, Seppi was a very underrated Grand Prix driver, having spent the bulk of his career uncomplainingly in second-rank equipment. He had the heart of a lion and, despite his frail appearance, was an immensely tough and doughty competitor - no doubt born of his motor cycling career, during which he won the 350 cc Swiss championship on a Gilera and passengered Edgar Strub in the 1959 sidecar World Championship. 
Sifferts first competition on four wheels came in 1960 when he raced in Formula Junior, but he really came to prominence the following year when, driving a Lotus 21, he won the Eifelrennen race among others to emerge as joint European Formula Junior champion with Tony Maggs. For 1962, Siffert decided to step up to Formula 1 with Ecurie Filipinetti. No results of note were achieved but he plugged away into 1963, buying the Filipinetti Lotus 24-BRM to run as an independent. He finally took a championship point at Reims and also won a poorly supported Syracuse GP and took second in the Imola GP. 
Purchasing a Brabham for 1964 increased his Grand Prix competitiveness and he scored a superb win in the Mediterranean GP, in which even the great Jim Clark had to take second best the final margin being a tenth of a second. Amazingly Seppi was to repeat the victory in 1965 when he again saw off the great Scot, this time by the huge margin of three-tenths of a second! Jo had joined the Walker team at the beginning of the year and was to strike up a wonderful relationship with Rob which saw them through the many tough times that were to follow. 
The 1966-67 seasons were a period of struggle when Siffert scraped the occasional point but top-three finishes were achieved only in non-title races. Hopes were high for 1968 when Walker persuaded Colin Chapman to provide him with a Lotus 49, and after the teams wonderful day at Brands Hatch Seppi was a front-runner for the rest of the year and sometimes quicker than the works car of Graham Hill. He was to stay with Rob for one more season which, after a bright start, faded disappointingly. By this time Siffert had established himself as a star of the Porsche sports car team, having won five major races in the 1969 season alone. A tempting offer from Ferrari was dangled in front of him but Porsche, desperate not to lose his services, paid for him to join the STP March team for 1970. It was an absolutely disastrous Grand Prix year for Seppi, only partly salvaged by success in Formula 2 with the works BMW and in sports car racing with the Gulf Porsche team, for whom he won the Targa Florio, the Spa 1000 Km and the Osterreichring 1000 Km, all with Brian Redman. 
Siffert set out on a hectic racing programme in 1971. He joined the BRM Formula 1 team, purchased a Chevron to race in F2 and a Porsche 917 for Can-Am and continued to race the works Porsche with Gulf/John Wyer. The season was a very successful one for Seppi. Apart from his dominant BRM triumph in the Austrian GP, he took plenty of top-three finishes in the other formulae and the popular Swiss had much to look forward to in 1972 when he arrived at Brands Hatch for the seasons finale, the Rothmans Victory Race. However, during the race a suspension failure sent the BRM P160 hurtling into a bank, the car bursting into flames. Poor Siffert was trapped in the wreckage and when he was finally extricated was found to have died of asphyxia, having survived the initial impact with a broken leg. Coming so soon after the loss of Pedro Rodriguez, the death of another of the sports great tigers was hard to bear.";
355;"Jo Bonnier";36;30.1.1930;"Дьюргарден, Стокгольм";;;;;"11.06.1972";"трасса Ле-Ман, Франция";"From a comfortable background, this Swedish driver had built a mighty reputation as an ice-racer in the early fifties with an Alfa Romeo Disco Volante, which led to him being appointed a distributor for that marque in 1954. Moving into circuit racing the following year, Bonnier soon proved to be a front-runner in Scandinavia before venturing further afield in 1956 to race the GT Alfa, winning events at Aintree, AVUS and Castelfusano, and taking a class win at the Nurburgring 1000 Km with Mackay-Fraser. By now he had started to run Maserati sports cars, and in 1957 became involved with the works team, finishing third in the Swedish GP in a SOOTS. 
Although he had not really reached the front rank of drivers, Jo bought a Maserati 250F which he raced in the 1957-58 seasons with only moderate results, the best being second places at Syracuse and Caen against meagre opposition. At the tail-end of 1958 he joined BRM and soon became the first driver to win a championship Grand Prix for Bourne when he won the 1959 Dutch GP. He was to stay with BRM until the end of the 1960 season, but never came close to repeating his Zandvoort triumph, although he comfortably led the 1960 Argentine GP until the engine failed. 
Having begun a successful association with Porsche in 1959, Bonnier took every opportunity to race for them again the following year, winning the Modena GP and taking a superb victory in the rain in the non-championship German GP in F2, and sharing the victorious RSK sports car with Herrmann in the Targa Florio. With the Porsche team planning a Grand Prix assault in 1961, Bonnier - feeling his talents were being overlooked at BRM -joined Dan Gurney to race the silver cars. After a winter interlude which included taking a Yeoman Credit Cooper to victory in New Zealand at the Teretonga international and at Levin, the 1961 season started with a second place in Seidels Lotus at Pau before Bonnier concentrated on his Porsche commitments. He made a promising beginning, with some good results in non-championship races, including second places at Solitude, Karlskoga and Modena and thirds at Syracuse and Zeltweg, but in Grands Prix things were much tougher, and he was increasingly overshadowed by Gurney, especially in 1962 when he endured a fairly depressing time with the new Porsche 804 flat-eight, with a second place at Solitude and a third at the Karlskoga GP his only worthwhile results. 
With Porsche withdrawing from Formula 1, Bonnier joined Rob Walker in 1963 and raced his privately entered cars for the next three seasons. When the mood took him he could still be extremely quick, but by now he seemed more interested in his pivotal role as leader of the newly formed Grand Prix Drivers Association. When Walker released him for 1966, Jo formed his own team, picking up occasional points racing a Cooper-Maserati and then a McLaren, as well as scrounging a few works drives, but he was really a shadow of his former self, especially in 1971, when he was very slow indeed. 
If nothing else Bonnier still enjoyed the life of a racing driver, and while the best days of his Grand Prix career had long been in the past, he raced sports cars with great gusto. He shared a Chaparral with Phil Hill to win the Nurburgring 1000 Km in 1966 and raced his own and the Ecurie Filipinettis Lola T70s with some minor success, but it was the acquisition of a 2-litre Lola in 1970 that seemingly reawakened the racer that had for so long lain dormant. He won G5/6 races at both Silverstone and Jyllandsring and took the European 2-litre championship with some terrific drives. 
Although just past 40, Bonniers racing activities showed no sign of slackening in 1971, and his lacklustre Grand Prix performances were thrown into sharp relief by some more good results in the sports car categories, including a third in the Targa Florio with Attwood, second place in the Auvergne Trophy and an outright win in the Barcelona 1000 Km with Peterson. Retiring from Formula 1 at the end of the season, Bonnier raced on in a new Lola T280. However, at Le Mans in 1972 he was involved in a collision with a privateer Ferrari, and Jos yellow Lola was launched over the barriers into the trees. The man who had spent so much time crusading for circuit safety over the years had become another victim among a whole generation of racers who paid the ultimate price.";

He was a Ford works driver from 1964 until he switched to Porsche, Vie then winning the Group 3 title in 1967 and the Monte Carlo Rally in 1968. By now he had become an established member of the Porsche sports car team and produced some dazzling performances, winning the Daytona 24 Hours (after doing the lions share of the driving), the Targa Florio - a truly epic performance - and the Nurburgring 1000 Km. Cooper, searching for a driver, offered Vie a chance at the French GP and he duly finished fourth first time out in the rain. He completed the season with them, but then the team folded. 
For 1969 Elford continued with Porsche in sports car racing - taking time out to finish 11th in the Daytona 500 in a Dodge! - and drove for privateer Colin Crabbe in F1. Things looked promising until he was involved in Mario Andrettis accident at the German GP, his McLaren hitting debris from the Americans car. Vie crashed badly and was lucky to escape with no worse than a broken arm and collar-bone. 
The crash effectively spelt the end of his Grand Prix career, but he was soon back in the Porsche and driving as well as ever, winning the 1970 Nurburgring 1000 Km with Ahrens. Elford drove for BRM in the German GP of 1971, but was not really given a fair crack of the whip. 
He raced on, driving for Porsche and Alfa Romeo in endurance events, handling Chaparrals, McLarens and Shadows in Can-Am, and a Chevron in F2, and even won a Trans-Am race in a Camaro at Watkins Glen before finally retiring in 1974.

He drove a variety of powerful sports machines in the early 1960s before concentrating on the popular Can-Am series. 
Though his car was somewhat outdated, he put up a number of fine performances, none better than in the wet at Laguna Seca in 1968 when he lapped the field to score an amazing win. This success led to a drive in Formula A in 1969 and an opportunity to drive single-seaters at last. John won three rounds and finished fourth in the championship. The next year he took the SCCA Formula A title and then set about a completely new challenge, tackling the US GP in a BRM and the Questor GP in a March 701, as well as a full season in European F2, achieving moderate success. 
It was back to the USA and the L & M F5000 series for 1972, although he also drove in some British F5000 rounds and was right on the pace. Thereafter Cannon continued racing in the formula which had brought him so much success, spiced with occasional drives in USAC and Can-Am.";
364;"Jack Brabham";8;2.4.1926;"Хертсвилл, Сидней";;;;;"";"";"Much has been made of Sir Jacks achievement in becoming the only driver to win the World Championship in a car of his own make. But that is only part of the story, for he was also the man who was largely responsible for developing the rear-engined Cooper which was to change the face of Formula 1 for ever; went to Indianapolis in 1961 and shook the establishment; built not only his own Grand Prix challenger but also a succession of superb Formula 2 cars which allowed so many drivers to shine; and was competitive to the end of his long career. Bowing out at the age of 44 in 1970, he could still show the youngsters a trick or two! 
Jack had spent a number of years in the cut and thrust of midget racing on the cinder tracks of his native Australia, winning four successive titles between 1948 and 1951, before switching to hill-climbs, taking the championship in 1953. That season Jack was bought a Cooper-Bristol which was christened the RedeX Special and began to clean up with it but, eager to progress, he came to England in 1955 and soon joined up with the Cooper team, making an early Grand Prix debut in the Bobtail special. Although he drove a Maserati 250F in 1956, taking third places in the Aintree 200 and the Vanwall Trophy at Snetterton, Jack spent most of the season racing Coopers 1500 cc sports car, while developing the Formula 2 car which he was to use to such great effect in 1957. 
In 1958 Moss won the Argentine GP with Rob Walkers little Cooper, proving that the car could be a serious contender, and Jack persevered with the works machine, steadily honing the ground-breaking design on a race-by-race basis. He took occasional national wins, for example in the London Trophy and the Gold Cup, before the start of two golden years in 1959-60 when the Cooper proved, if not always unbeatable, at least very reliable, and Brabham won his first two championship titles, taking seven Grand Prix wins in the process. Other victories included the Brussels and Pau GPs in 1960, and the International Trophy in 1961, the year the teams fortunes began to slip. 
In 1962 Jack branched out on his own, using a Lotus as a stop-gap while his first Brabham was completed. It was late in the season before the BT3 appeared but this simple spaceframe car was very effective, soon taking World Championship points and a second place in the non-title Mexican GP. For 1963, Jack signed Dan Gurney to drive for the team and with such a fine driver on board he sometimes took a back seat, but his delight on the occasions when he beat the lanky Californian was obvious. Although Jack did not manage a championship win with his Brabham in the 1.5-litre formula, he scored a number of non-title victories, including races at Solitude and Zeltweg in 1963, and the International Trophy and Aintree 200 in 1964. In addition, he was very successful during the winter trips down-under for the Tasman series and in the newly introduced Formula 2, where he took four first places and two seconds in seven 1964 starts. 
Brabhams finest season was 1966, when he won four championship Grands Prix with the ultra-reliable Repco-engined car to secure his third title, in addition to the F1 International Trophy and Gold Cup races, and no fewer than ten Formula 2 events in the Brabham-Honda. For 1967 reliability paid dividends once more; Jack took a couple of wins but Denny Hulme won the title for Brabham before heading off to McLaren. The Repco success was a minor miracle which couldnt last, and it didnt, with the four-cam 1968 engine a disastrous failure that blighted the season. Brabham switched to Ford power for 1969 and signed Jacky Ickx, but still won the International Trophy and had another crack at Indianapolis which ended in retirement with ignition troubles. In 1970, Jacks final year, he was quickly out of the traps with a runaway victory in South Africa, before enduring the heartache of losing a win at Monaco on the last corner when pressured into a mistake by Rindt. He also led the British GP until running out of fuel on the last lap, with Rindt once again the beneficiary. 
Upon his retirement Brabham sold up and walked away from racing to spend more time on his other business interests, but the sport would not let him go. His three sons, Geoff, Gary and David, all became successful drivers in their own right, and the old man is often seen at the circuits, proffering his advice, no doubt, in his own inimitable and economical way.";

Under the wing of Willment he continued his winning ways in 1965 and received a third-place Grovewood Award. 
Scoring nine consecutive wins with the Willment Lotus Elan at the start of 1966, John soon became involved with the works team, racing the GT Europa and F3 Lotus 41 in 1967 and 1968 with tremendous success. A planned season with Lotus in Formula 2 in 1969 never took off, but he did finish third in the Rome GP and fifth at Hockhenheim from three starts before Colin Chapman entrusted him with the task of developing the Lotus 63 4WD car in five Grands Prix. 
His reward was a place alongside Jochen Rindt in the Lotus team for the 1970 season, which started well with a fifth place in the Lotus 49C in South Africa, but gradually declined as Miles apprehension over the fragility of the new Lotus 72 steadily grew. After Rindts fatal crash at Monza, John was summarily replaced by Reine Wisell and his Grand Prix career was done. He did make a brief appearance for BRM in the non-championship Jochen Rindt Memorial race at Hockenheim the following season, whilst racing for the DART sports car team, but soon retired to concentrate on his new occupation as a motoring journalist, road-testing cars, before returning to Lotus Cars in an engineering capacity.";

On his return to his homeland he found employment with Syd van der Vyver who also gave him the chance to his first chance to race. Moving to Johannesburg, he helped Doug Serrurier and Ernest Pieterse in building the Alfa special in 1960, but it was 1962 before the eager de Klerk was to get behind the wheel.
de Klerk quickly began to gain good placings with the car and was subsequently entrusted with a Brabham-Climax with which he was able to challenge more strongly the local maestro John Love. Piet, however, always seemed to be bridesmaid, finishing second on numerous occasions before temporarily abandoning single-seaters at the end of 1965 when Mike de Udy offered hi the chance to race abroad in his Porsche Carrera 6 sports cars.
In 1967 he drove a Lola-Aston Martin at Le Mans, before resuming his South African career in late 1968 with Love's old Brabham BT20. before once more concentrating on sports cars into the early seventies.
PEDRO de la ROSA
It was the end of a long and winding road for Pedro when he finally found his way onto the Grand Prix grid in 1999. After karting from an early age, the Spaniard was the national Fiat Uno champion way back in 1989 and took the Formula Ford title the following year, which led to a move into Formula Renault in Britain.
This championship was duly added to the list in 1992 and when de la Rosa graduated to Formula 3 in 1993 his upward career curve seemed untroubled. However, a satisfactory sixth place in that learning year was followed by a nightmare season when, saddled with an uncompetitive Renault engine, he could only watch as Jan Magnussen blitzed the rest of the field. Fortunately a late-season engine change proved there was nothing wrong with the driver, who then decided to progress his career in Japanese Formula 3.
Driving for TOM'S, he trounced the opposition with eight pole positions and eight wins from the nine rounds of the series, ensuring a move up to Formula Nippon for 1996. In his first year at this level Pedro was always quick but was let down by his lack of experience, which denied him better finishes. He was a good learner, though, and the following season took his Nova Engineering Lola to the championship with six wins from the ten rounds. As if his cup was not overflowing, de la Rosa also clinched the All-Japan GT championship in a Toyota Supra.
Seeing no purpose in racing in the European F3000 series, Pedro secured backing from Repsol and negotiated a place for himself as the Jordan test driver for 1998, impressing all concerned with his technical feedback.
His ability to make a healthy contribution to the Arrows sponsorship budget was no doubt a huge factor in Tom Walkinshaw's decision to sign the Spaniard the following season, but he soon proved his worth by scoring a priceless point for the team on his Grand Prix debut in Melbourne. Thereafter, lack of development saw Arrows treading water but Pedro was held in high esteem by the team, who regard him as a good find with excellent future prospects in Formula 1.";
367;"Jochen Rindt";22;18.4.1942;"Майнц-на-Рейне, Германия";;;;;"05.09.1970";"Милан, Италия";"You really needed to see Rindt in action to appreciate his genius. The little skittering Formula 2 cars were thrown to the limits of their adhesion as he almost danced them to win after win. Then his phenomenal skill took the huge overweight Cooper-Maserati into undreamed-of angles as the unwieldy beast was driven with such ferocity that, inevitably perhaps, finishes were few and far between. 
Although Rindt had been around in Formula Junior and taken part in the non-championship 1963 Austrian GP, his potential remained hidden until he burst upon an unsuspecting British public at a big Formula 2 race at Crystal Palace in 1964. Sensationally he defeated the established aces of the day in the formula that was to become largely his personal domain in future years. With the Zeltweg race part of the championship calendar that year, Rindt hired Rob Walkers Brabham. Though he retired in the race, Jochen was keen to drive for Walkers equipe in 1965, but while Rob greatly admired the Austrians talents he felt his career would be better nurtured at Cooper. 
His first season with the team was spent learning the ropes under the tutelage of Bruce McLaren, and success was found more regularly in Formula 2, although his big win that year was at Le Mans where he took a NART-entered Ferrari 250LM to an unlikely victory with Masten Gregory. Coopers competitiveness was restored in 1966 when Jochen emerged as a true front-runner, although he was pushed aside somewhat by the mid-season arrival of John Surtees. Signing a three-year deal with Cooper proved to have been a big mistake when Rindt was trapped in a poor car in 1967, but he spent his energies making up for it in Formula 2, taking Roy Winkelmanns Brabham to nine victories and four second places from 15 starts. 
Joining a Brabham team fresh from two World Championships should have been the passport to well-deserved Grand Prix success for Rindt but, alas, it was not to be. The latest Repco engine proved to be hopelessly unreliable and Jochen was left with just a couple of third places at the end of the year. He also had a shot at Indianapolis in the teams BT25-Repco, but his race ended in retirement. Rindts Formula 2 success continued unabated, but the lack of Grand Prix success led him to accept a drive at Lotus alongside Graham Hill for the 1969 season. Although he had equal status with the new World Champion, it soon became clear during the Tasman series that he had the edge, Jochen winning races at Christchurch and Warwick Farm. 
The European season started badly for Rindt when he crashed in the Spanish GP after the massive rear aerofoil collapsed, putting him into hospital. He was back to his best by the British GP, where he fought a glorious duel with Stewarts Matra before minor problems dropped him from contention. He could not be denied much longer, however, taking his long-awaited maiden Grand Prix victory at Watkins Glen. Although Colin Chapman had supplied Rindt with a car worthy of his talents, theirs was an uneasy alliance. Jochen would dearly have liked to have returned to Brabham - now a competitive force again - but in the end lashings of money, the promise of total number-one status and a ground-breaking new car for 1970 held sway. 
After starting the year in the old Lotus 49, taking second in the Race of Champions, Rindt gave the sensational-looking Lotus 72 its debut in Spain. However, it still needed some development and for Monaco Jochen was back in the old car. It was here he took perhaps his most famous victory, his incredible late-race charge forcing Jack Brabham into a final-corner error. The new 72 was finally considered fully raceworthy at Zandvoort and Jochen scored the first of four successive wins which put him within touching distance of the title. At Brands Hatch he was very lucky, as Brabham ran out of fuel on the last lap, but at Hockenheim he and Jacky Ickx gave a wonderful display of high-speed artistry. Having previously agreed places on the circuit where overtaking manoeuvres were acceptable, both drivers fought a great battle within those parameters. At the finish Chapman, who by now had grown much closer to Rindt than had seemed possible a year before, offered his congratulations. A monkey could have won in your car today, was Jochens retort. Then came Monza. There were rumours of retirement, for Jochen had lost close friends Bruce McLaren and Piers Courage in accidents in the preceding months. However, during practice something broke on the car, which veered at enormous speed into the barrier. The front of the Lotus was totally destroyed and poor Rindt was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital in Milan. A month later at Watkins Glen, the inexperienced Emerson Fittipaldi took the Lotus 72 to a surprise victory, thus ensuring that Rindt became the sports first and to date, thankfully, only posthumous World Champion.";
368;"Johnny  Servoz-Gavin";10;18.1.1942;"Гренобль";;;;;"";"";"Georges Johnny Servoz-Gavin was a handsome, blond playboy racer who loved the good life, but significantly he also possessed a great deal of talent. 
After being thrown out of the Winfield driving school in 1963, Johnny did a little rallying in 1964, before spending all his money on a Brabham for 1965. He was wild but fast, taking fourth place in the French F3 series to earn a drive with Matra in 1966. Although he was promoted to the Matra Formula 2 team for 1967, his results were moderate, and only a splendid fourth in the F1/F2 non-title Spanish GP kept him on board. 
An accident to Jackie Stewart early in 1968 brought the Frenchman a glorious opportunity to show his ability. In Ken Tyrrells Matra he sensationally led the Monaco GP, but clipped a barrier which broke a driveshaft. Later in the season he redeemed himself with a superb second place in the Italian GP, but he still lacked a full-time Grand Prix ride. 
For 1969 he concentrated on the European F2 championship, and with victory in the Rome GP took the title of top non-graded driver. In Grands Prix, he was mainly entrusted with the Matra MS84, and succeeded in gaining a point with it at Mosport, the only time any 4WD car achieved this feat. 
The following season, Johnny was paired with Jackie Stewart in the Tyrrell team, running the difficult March 701. He finished fifth in the Spanish GP, but failed to qualify at Monaco, which caused him suddenly to announce his retirement. 
Ultimately he had decided that the risks inherent in racing at the time were not worthwhile, but there was also, apparently, a problem with his vision, which may have been the deciding factor.";
369;"Bruce McLaren";38;30.8.1937;"Окленд";;;;;"02.06.1970";"трасса Гудвуд, Сассекс, Англия";"Of all the many motor racing fatalities of the era, the death of Bruce McLaren was perhaps the most shocking. By general consensus the safest driver in the sport, his fatal accident while testing his Can-Am McLaren at Goodwood in 1970 was greeted at the time with utter disbelief. 
Arriving in Europe virtually unknown, but with the endorsement of Jack Brabham, on a scholarship from the New Zealand Grand Prix Association in March 1958, McLarens early career was sensational. In Formula 2 with a works Cooper, he took a class win and fifth overall in the German Grand Prix and, showing a maturity beyond his years, mixed it with seasoned competitors on unfamiliar tracks to such good effect that he finished runner-up in the Autocar F2 championship. Promoted to the F1 works team with Brabham in 1959, Bruce was completely unfazed in the top flight and at the end of the season became the youngest-ever GP winner (at 22) when he won the US GP at Sebring. The 1960 season opened with another triumph, this time in Argentina, but the rest of the year saw him content to understudy Brabham as he headed towards a second successive title. There is no doubt that Bruce learned much from his mentor, who moved on at the end of 1961 to build his own cars. Unfortunately, Coopers fortunes now began to decline, although McLaren picked up a fortunate win at Monaco and also won the non-title Reims GP. During this period Bruce was happy to spend the winter months back home competing in the Tasman series which provided him with a number of wins. In 1964 he was forced to enter his own cars down-under and thus Bruce McLaren Motor Racing was born. That year also saw a great ambition fulfilled when he won the New Zealand GP at his eighth attempt. Tragedy struck with the death of Tim Mayer, whom Bruce had taken under his wing, but the young Americans elder brother Teddy stayed on to become a pillar of the new team which slowly took shape over the next two seasons. Initially the programme centered on the Cooper Zerex Special sports car, later developments of which were to lead towards the teams successful Can-Am cars, which formed the basis of McLarens emergence as a constructor. Meanwhile Bruce plugged away faithfully at Cooper to the end of the 1965 season, but his various freelance activities, which included racing for Ford in endurance events, had grown to such an extent that the final break was inevitable. 
He introduced the white Formula 1 McLaren in 1966, but his season was hampered by the lack of a suitable engine, and the demands of a sports car programme with the McLaren Elva Oldsmobile which by this time was really taking off in North America. However, the highlight of the year for Bruce was winning the Le Mans 24 Hours for Ford with Chris Amon. The pace of expansion continued in 1967, when McLaren was totally involved in F1, now with BRM power. However, this was still an interim unit - indeed, Bruce was glad to race Dan Gurneys second Eagle for a spell after Ginthers sudden retirement rather than use his own machine. A Formula 2 version of the car appeared for the first time which Bruce drove when sports car and F1 commitments permitted. In addition, he shared the victorious Ford Mk II with Andretti at the Sebring 12 Hours, and also won rounds of the growing Can-Am series at Monterey and Riverside on his way to the title. 
Clearly the task of heading the team and developing and driving the cars was becoming too much for Bruce to handle on his own, and he tempted Denny Hulme from Brabham for 1968 to take some of the weight off his shoulders. It was a move that showed his wisdom, for he was quite prepared to play second fiddle to the new World Champion, though when the mood took him McLaren the racer, for so long closeted, was allowed to re-emerge, as at Brands Hatch where he unleashed a stunning performance to win the Race of Champions in the bright-tangerine M7A. Onlookers that day were tempted to wonder just what reservoirs of talent lay untapped. Shortly afterwards he took his final Grand Prix win at Spa, but it was Hulme who led the teams title challenge for the rest of the season. However, it was the ever-consistent Bruce who enjoyed the uper hand in 1969, finishing third in the championship behind Stewart and Ickx. He also took the Can-Am title for the second time, dominating the series with six outright victories and three second places. 
Though there were hints of impending retirement, Bruce carried on racing into 1970, with plans afoot to tackle Indianapolis after the success of the Can-Am cars. In due course a McLaren would win the Indy 500, but sadly the teams founder and inspiration was not around to see the success. He perished on a sunny June afternoon when a piece of bodywork flew from the car, sending it out of control. Poor Bruce was killed instantly when the car careered into a disused marshals post. 
Mention the name McLaren in the 1990s and most people will immediately think of the wonderful red and white cars which have established so many records. But Ron Dennis can surely testify that all those lucky enough to have either met the remarkable New Zealander or seen him in action will also never forget the man with the silver helmet in the tangerine car who began it all some three decades ago.";
370;"Piers   Courage";1;27.5.1942;"Колчестер, Эссекс";;;;;"21.06.1970";"трасса Зандвоорт, Голландия";"Piers was the eldest son of the chairman of the Courage brewery group, but any thoughts that these connections were an asset to his motor racing aspirations were mistaken. His initial racing experience was gained regularly gyrating the Lotus Seven funded by his father, but after that Piers was on his own as far as finance was concerned. He teamed up with old pal Jonathan Williams in 1964 and the pair terrorised the circuits of Europe, initially with a Lotus 22. Entered under the grandiose Anglo-Swiss Racing Team banner, in reality Courage and Williams lived the sort of hand-to-mouth existence that most privateers had to endure, but third place at Reims and second at Zandvoort in a Brabham encouraged Piers to contest a full F3 season in 1965. 
Charles Lucas entered a pair of Brabhams for Piers and Frank Williams, and it proved to be a very successful campaign for Courage, with four wins in major events at Silverstone, Goodwood, Caserta and Reims. This led to an invitation to race the Lotus 41 F3 car for 1966, and although it was inferior to the rival Brabhams Piers still managed a string of wins, earning a ride in Ron Harris works F2 Lotus in the German GP, where he blotted his copybook by crashing. 
BRM signed both Courage and Chris Irwin for 1967, the idea being to run them under the Tim Parnell banner, grooming them for a drive in the works team in the future. It all went sour for Piers very quickly, however, all his good work being repeatedly undone by silly spins. After the Monaco GP, Parnell stuck with Irwin, but Piers had to content himself with a season of Formula 2 in John Coombs McLaren. His speed was not in doubt and some excellent drives netted him fourth place in the non-graded drivers championship, but - and it was a big but -the disturbing tendency to crash remained, with major shunts at Pau, Enna and Brands Hatch. Coombs advised him to quit, but Piers was determined to continue. 
Early in 1968 he bought the McLaren from Coombs and took it down-under to contest the Tasman series. Pitted against the Lotuses of Clark and Hill, Amons Ferrari and McLarens BRM in the seven-race series, Piers was second, fourth, fifth, third, third and fifth before the final round at Longford. In pouring rain Courage simply outdrove the opposition - Clark included - to win the race, but more importantly finally established his credibility. 
Turning down an offer to replace the late Jim Clark at Lotus, Piers instead chose to race for Tim Parnell in Grands Prix while teaming up with his old pal Frank Williams in Formula 2, and so successful was their partnership that it was decided to enter F1 with a Brabham in 1969. Aside from a shunt at the Nurburgring, things could hardly have gone better, Courage driving superbly for the fledgling outfit to take second place at Monaco and Watkins Glen. He was also still racing in Formula 2, scoring a win at Enna and five third places, while an invitation to join the Matra team for Le Mans saw Piers take fourth place with Beltoise. 
For 1970 Williams took the brave and possibly foolhardy step of running the newly constructed de Tomaso-Ford in place of the proven Brabham. The early part of the season was inconclusive with only a third place in the International Trophy to show for their efforts. Meanwhile Piers busied himself in a hectic schedule of endurance events for Alfa Romeo, highlighted by a win with de Adamich in the Buenos Aires 1000 Km. By the time of the Dutch GP at Zandvoort in June, progress seemed to have been made with the de Tomaso, which was placed ninth on the grid, but in the race tragedy struck when Courage slid wide, ran up a bank and crashed. The red car rolled over and burst into flames, and the unfortunate Piers stood no chance.";

He progressed to the works Alfa team in 1966, winning the touring car section of the European mountain-climb championship the following year. Giunti was a regular member of the Autodelta sports car team in 1968, taking second in the Targa Florio and fourth (and class win) at Le Mans with Galli, who was his regular partner through into 1969. 
For 1970, Ignazio was signed by Ferrari for their successful sports car programme, sharing the winning 512S in the Sebring 12 Hours, Targa Florio and Rand 9 Hours, also taking second place in the Monza 1000 Km and third in the Watkins Glen 6 Hours. Meanwhile Giunti made a very impressive Grand Prix debut to finish fourth at Spa, earning three more drives. Though Regazzoni had laid claim to the number two seat in F1, Giunti stayed with the team for 1971. In the seasons first sports car race, the Buenos Aires 1000 Km, Ignazio, unsighted by another car, ploughed into the back of the Matra of Beltoise which had run out of fuel and was being pushed along the track by its driver. The Ferrari somersaulted some 200 yards down the track, exploding into flames, leaving poor Giunti no chance of survival. Sustaining 70 per cent burns and multiple injuries, he died in hospital some two hours later.";
372;"Dan Gurney";24;13.4.1931;"Порт-Джефферсон, Нью-Йорк";;;;;"";"";"Some drivers seem to exude a natural warmth, and by their demeanour both on and off the track firmly entrench themselves in the hearts of motor racing fans across the globe. Dan Gurney comes into this category. Standing at Paddock Bend at the start of the 1968 British Grand Prix, I remember spontaneously cheering loudly with the rest as he set off in grim but hopeless pursuit of the field, Lady Luck having left him stranded on the line. This minor moment serves to underline how universally popular the tall American was and still is to this day, not only for his many fine achievements but also for his stature as one of the sports least affected and most enthusiastic participants. 
The son of an opera singer, Gurney revelled in the environment of his Riverside youth, taking little interest in his studies, but enjoying the illicit drag racing around the local strips. After National Service he began his competition career in 1955 with a Triumph TR2, before building his reputation with a Porsche. By 1957 Dan was running a Ferrari entered by Frank Arciero, and was so successful that Luigi Chinetti arranged for him to race at Le Mans and Reims in 1958. In both races his co-driver crashed the car, but Dan had shown sufficient promise to be offered a test with Ferrari late that year. 
Signing a contract with the wily Commendatore for the 1959 season which bound him tightly, Gurney soon proved to be a major asset, particularly after the acrimonious departure of Behra, scoring points in three of his four Grands Prix. The strictures of Maranello were such that Dan decided to join BRM for 1960, but it was an unhappy year with the car woefully unreliable - made even worse by a freak accident at Zandvoort in which a small boy was killed when Dans brakes failed and the car crashed. Joining Porsche for 1961, Gurney found that the four-cylinder car was reliable (he finished all but one of his 14 Formula 1 races) but not quite capable of winning. He stayed on for 1962 and gained some reward with the flat-eight car, winning his first Grand Prix at Rouen and then the non-title race at Solitude. This was to be the pinnacle of Porsches achievements as a manufacturer in Formula 1, as they withdrew at seasons end, leaving Dan to join Jack Brabham as the teams number one driver for Formula 1, but free to continue his sports and USAC programme which had begun so promisingly in 1962. Again it was so near yet so far in Grands Prix as Gurney repeatedly challenged Jim Clark et al. over the next three seasons but was almost invariably frustrated by niggling problems which restricted him to just two victories. It seems ironic that after his departure to build his own Eagle racers the Brabham should have come good and won the World Championship for the next two seasons. 
Gurneys Anglo American Racers car looked superb in its dark-blue livery, but stood no chance of success until its punchless four-cylinder Climax engine was replaced by the complex but potent Weslake unit. By 1967 this was a truly competitive proposition and Dan took victories in the Race of Champions and the Belgian GP before the onslaught of Cosworth power eventually overwhelmed the project. June of that year was kind to Dan, who also shared a Ford GT40 with A J Foyt to win the Le Mans 24 Hours. By now Gurney was extending his efforts to Can-Am and USAC, and after winning the Rex Mays 100 at Riverside in 1967 he finished second in the Indianapolis 500 the following season as well as winning at Mosport and Riverside again. 
Formula 1 seemed a thing of the past in 1969 as Dan developed his USAC programme, finishing second at Indy yet again but winning at Donnybrooke. The following year he won at Sears Point and was third at Indy, before stepping into the breach at McLaren following Bruces tragic death in a testing accident at Goodwood. After being away Dan never really found the pace in Formula 1, but he won two of the three Can-Am rounds he contested before problems over conflicting oil contracts precipitated his departure from the team. Realising that perhaps his best days were now behind him, he retired from racing, his place in the USAC team being filled by Bobby Unser, who was to bring Eagle so much success in the seventies. Happily Dan was not tempted to return full-time, but he couldnt resist a one-off NASCAR outing in 1980 at his home track of Riverside, where he lay a superb third before gearbox trouble. 
Gurney continued to enter his Eagles in USAC and had the satisfaction of winning Indy at last, as a constructor if not as a driver, with Gordon Johncock and Bobby Unser scoring victories in 1973 and 1975 respectively. Dan eventually withdrew from single-seater racing, concentrating successfully on IMSA with the backing of Toyota throughout the early nineties. 
In 1996 he re-entered the CART arena in partnership with the Japanese car giant, but the four-year alliance has brought little but disappointment for Gurney and his hard-working team at Santa Anna. The slow development of the Toyota powerplant, increasingly uncompetitive Goodyear tyres and the lack of a front-line driver are just some of the reasons that the Eagle has failed to soar to the heights that the partners were expecting.";

A fine second place in the F2 class in the 1966 German GP in a Matra then pointed Hahne in the direction of single-seaters and he became the non-graded works driver in the Lola-BMW for 1967 and a couple of races in 1968, when he returned to BMW tourers and also had the occasional Ford ride. 
For 1969, Hubert was back with BMWs own F2 car, taking two second places at Hockenheim and a fourth in the Eifelrennen, although the season was marred by the death of Gerhard Mitter in practice for the German Grand Prix. He continued in F2 with BMW in 1970, winning the Rhine Cup race at Hockenheim, but had little other success. Taking delivery of a March 701 for the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim, he naturally expected to do well at his favourite circuit and there was much consternation when he failed to qualify the car. A disgruntled Hahne threatened legal action, contending that the car was delivered in an unraceworthy condition, but after this had been disproved by Ronnie Peterson in a subsequent test Hahne announced his retirement from racing.";

He took to the hills in 1962 with a Cooper-Daimler, and when the V8 was dropped into his own Felday chassis in 1965 his first British hill-climb championship was duly attained. For the following year Westbury got his hands on the Ferguson 4WD, which proved almost unbeatable. 
Although he continued to compete in 1965, Peter was busy building up his Felday Engineering firm, but he made a successful transition to Formula 3 in 1967 with a Brabham BT21. He won races at Silverstone, Chimay and Clermont Ferrand, and took further victories at Chimay again and Reims in 1968. 
That year saw a couple of Formula 2 drives, before a full season in 1969 with his own Brabham BT50 which yielded second place in the Lottery GP at Monza and fifth in the F2 class of the German GP. 
Peter was given a chance to try a pukka F1 machine when he joined BRM for the 1970 US GP, but the car suffered a blown engine and the disappointed driver failed to qualify.

In 1963, driving a Mk 5A Lola-Ford, Dickie shot to international prominence by winning the Monaco Formula Junior race, and his performances won him the first Grovewood Award and the princely sum of ?500. 
In 1964 Attwood was given a couple of chances in the works BRM, taking fourth in the News of the World Trophy at Goodwood, but non-starting the 4WD P67 at the British GP. Racing in Formula 2 for MRP, he produced some excellent performances, most notably a win at Aspern in the Vienna GP, and second place - behind Clark - at Pau, plus further runner-up spots in the Eifelrennen and at Albi. His ability was being recognised more widely, and he became a founder member of the Ford sports-prototype team. 
Joining Parnell Racing, Richard drove the teams none-too-quick Lotus 25-BRM sensibly to two points-scoring finishes, while in F2 he was again second at Pau, and won the Rome GP at Vallelunga. His sports car career was now taking off, and he began what was to be a long and successful partnership with David Piper, ending the season with a fantastic drive to win the Rand 9 Hours in Pipers Ferrari 365 P2. 
Driving for BRM in the 1966 Tasman series, Attwood won the Gold Leaf Trophy race at Levin before another season of F2 and sports car events, which once again ended with a win at Kyalami in the Rand 9 Hours. Despite another successful Tasman interlude in New Zealand, where he took two second places and two thirds in four starts, Richards only other single-seater drive in 1967 was a works Cooper outing at Mosport. 
When Mike Spence was so tragically killed at Indianapolis, early in 1968, Attwood was signed to replace him at BRM. His debut for the team at Monaco was stunning, Dickie taking second place and fastest lap. Unfortunately subsequent performances were not so impressive and after the German GP he was released from his contract, returning to sports car racing. 
In 1969 he was called back to F1 to try and reprise his Monaco performance for Lotus when Rindt was recovering from injury, scoring a fine fourth place, while later in the season he took Frank Williams F2 Brabham to sixth (and second in class) at the Nurburgring. It was also the season in which he raced a factory Porsche for the first time, sharing a 908 Spyder with Elford to take second place in the BOAC 500. In 1970 he scored his greatest triumph, winning Le Mans in a Porsche 917 with Hans Herrmann, and took second place with the German at the Nurburgring 1000 Km. In 1971, Attwoods final racing year, he drove the John Wyer/Gulf Porsche, winning the Osterreichring 1000 Km with Rodriguez, and finishing second at Le Mans with Muller. 
Retiring at the end of the season for business reasons, Attwood was occasionally tempted back to the circuits in the eighties, mainly in historic sports car events, but also at Le Mans in 1984 when he raced a Nimrod.";

He had the backing to enable him to enter the original Eagle - hopelessly, as it turned out - in three successive Canadian GPs (1967-69).

A couple of outings in Can-Am in 1968 encouraged Cordts to become a regular in this series between 1969 and 1974, driving a succession of Chevrolet-powered McLarens. By far his best result was a second place in the Road America round at Elkhart Lake in 1974, but by this time the once vibrant series had lost much of its credibility.";
381;"Jim Clark";1;4.3.1936;"Килмани, Файфшир, Шотландия";;;;;"07.04.1968";"трасса Хокенхайм, Германия";"It really was a different era, the mid-sixties. There was no hype, the Grand Prix world was just a small close-knit community of rivals who were still friends, and the mega-buck world of sponsorship was only just looming around the corner. Jim Clarks tragic death in a relatively meaningless Formula 2 race at Hockenheim on 7 April 1968 was a savage blow to everyone connected with the sport, which from that day seemed to change; suddenly it was more of a business. That Clark was not part of the new commercial order perversely seemed somehow fitting, yet in reality Clark was the supreme modern professional racing driver of his day, becoming a tax-exile to maximise his earnings, and employing a manager to run his farming affairs back home in Scotland. 
It was this well-off agricultural environment that provided the background to his early motor racing activities -just minor rallies and trials to start with, before he graduated to the Porsche with which he began to make his name in 1958. Despite strong parental opposition, young Jimmy was soon racing for the Border Reivers in their Jaguar D-Type, a little Lotus Elite and the rather more potent Lister Jaguar with which he took 12 wins in the 1959 season. Clark agreed to drive for Aston Martins Grand Prix team in 1960, but the project was delayed and he was released to Lotus for Formula 2 and Junior racing. However, once Colin Chapman had him under contract he lost no time in promoting him to the Grand Prix team, although the priority was the Junior championship, in which he tied for the title with Trevor Taylor. He was also committed to the Reivers sports car team, sharing the third-placed Aston Martin DBR1 with Salvadori in the Le Mans 24 Hours, a race he disliked so much that he refused to participate in it after the Lotus 23 failed to pass scrutineering in 1962. 
The 1961 season saw the introduction of the new 1.5-litre formula and Clark could concentrate fully on the championship Grands Prix and the proliferation of lesser meetings which were organised. He took his first F1 win at Pau, but the year saw little luck come the Scotsmans way, culminating in the tragic collision with von Trips Ferrari at Monza in September, from which he was fortunate indeed to emerge shocked but unscathed. However, the end-of-season sunshine races in South Africa provided instant and welcome rehabilitation, with Jimmy winning the non-championship Rand, Natal and South African GPs. 
For 1962 Chapman built the magnificent monocoque Lotus 25, which, propelled by the Climax V8 engine and driven by Jimmy, simply became the standard-setter for the next three years. Much is made of the heartbreaking failure at East London which cost Clark the championship, but that is harsh indeed on Graham Hill, who suffered equal bad luck earlier in the season, and fully deserved the crown. There were no hiccoughs in 1963, though, as Jimmy scorched to the title, winning no fewer than seven championship Grands Prix and non-title races at Pau, Imola, Silverstone, Kalskoga and Oulton Park. Lotus also made their first assault on USAC racing, with Clark shaking Indianapolis to its roots with the funny little rear-engined car and taking second place on its first appearance. To prove it was no fluke, later in the season he won the Milwaukee 200. The revolution had truly begun. 
Jimmy was still indisputably the man to beat in 1964, but unreliability, particularly with the new Lotus 33, saw the title pass to Surtees at the very last gasp in Mexico. However, Clark had thrilled the fans as never before, particularly those in Britain who were also lucky enough to watch him three-wheeling the Lotus Ford Cortina with such abandon. Having seen the championship lost, Clark and Chapman were in no mood to face a repeat of their misfortunes in 1965 and after a highly successful winter Tasman series, which yielded five wins, their World Championship rivals were subjected to the full onslaught of the cars performance and Jimmys brilliance. Leaving aside Monaco (which Clark skipped in order to win the Indy 500), he won the first six Grands Prix of the season to put the outcome of the championship beyond doubt by August. 
The new 3-litre formula for once found Chapman without a ready answer, Team Lotus having to make do with 2-litre Climax engines until the BRM H16s became available. Clark was now in the unusual position of an underdog, which made for a fascinating year, illuminated by superb drives at Zandvoort, where he used all his powers to bring a sick car into third place, and at Watkins Glen, where he took the BRM H16 engine to its only championship victory. But, untypically, there were rare moments when he let his frustrations show, such as when he slid off in the wet at the Nurburgring. 
The following year saw the advent of the Lotus 49-Cosworth V8 and Clark gave us the full repertoire of his bounteous gifts. That Denny Hulme won the championship seemed almost unimportant (yes, it really was different in those days!), for all eyes were on Clark. A crushing win on the cars debut in the Dutch GP, one of Grand Prix racings greatest-ever drives at Monza when he made up almost a whole lap on the opposition only to run short of fuel on the last lap having regained the lead, and his skill in bringing the car home at Watkins Glen with the rear suspension broken and the wheel angled drunkenly as he crossed the finish line live fresh in the memory to this day. The 1968 season began in typical Clark fashion, with an unruffled win in the South African GP to take his tally of World Championship Grand Prix victories to 25, overhauling the legendary Fangios then record total. Little did the world suspect that he would never compete in a Grand Prix again. For after another enjoyable trip down-under during which he won four Tasman races from seven starts, and a Formula 2 race at Barcelona, came Hockenheim... 
More than 25 years have passed since Clarks death, but he stands as one of the truly great drivers of any era. On the track only Ayrton Senna in modern-day racing could compare, for both drivers set the benchmark for their peers with performances that were often truly extraordinary. It is a shame that, while the brilliance of the Brazilian in the eighties and nineties has been captured for posterity, such were the times that the magnificence of Jimmys career went largely unrecorded on moving film. Indeed interviews are also exceedingly rare, and thus those too young to have seen him race will sadly have to make do with very much second best by way of the written word.";
382;"Mike Spence";1;30.12.1936;"Кройдон, Суррей";;;;;"07.05.1968";"Индианаполис, Индиана";"Spence overcame polio as a child with no ill effects, and from a young age he harboured dreams of becoming a racing driver. After his Army service was finished he took up club racing in 1958 with a Turner, before going into Formula Junior in 1960 with a Cooper-Austin. He made his Formula 1 debut the following year with an Emeryson-Climax at Solitude, and won the minor Commander York Trophy at Silverstone in the same car. For 1962, Spence entered his own Formula Junior Lotus under the wing of Ian Walkers team, with Mike preparing the car himself in the evenings after his day job was done. He had only one big win - at Reims - but scored many placings and was taken on by Lotus on a three-year contract in 1963. 
The fair-haired Englishman drove in the Formula Junior team, but the car proved difficult to handle and Mikes confidence dropped. However, things gradually came round when the car was made more competitive, and he enjoyed a late-season boost when he stood in for the injured Trevor Taylor at Monza. In 1964 Mike was planning a season of Formula 2 and the occasional Grand Prix when he found himself thrust into the F1 team after Arundells accident. 
For one so inexperienced he coped well, especially as Peter had made such a big impression in his few starts. Colin Chapman had no hesitation in keeping Spence in the team with Jim Clark for 1965, and he soon repaid that faith by winning the Race of Champions and performing well on other occasions. With Arundell fit to return for 1966, Mike was out of a drive, but he bade farewell by winning the non-championship South African GP on New Years Day, before spending the rest of the year marking time with Tim Parnells team. Joining the works BRM line-up for 1967 was a step back up, but he was given the task of sorting the troublesome BRM H16 car and did superbly to bring it to five points finishes. He also raced the fabulous winged Chaparral with Phil Hill, which was quick but fragile, suffering repeated transmission failures, but at Brands Hatch in the BOAC 500 the car had its great day, crushing the Ferraris. 
In 1968, Mike Spence had been racing for ten years; it had been a long haul to the top, but suddenly his talent had begun to flower, and he was about to take his rightful place among the very top echelon of his profession. Yet fate would decree otherwise. The shadow of Jim Clark, which had, perhaps inevitably, held him back throughout his years at Lotus, passed over him once more as he took over the late Scotsmans Lotus for the forthcoming Indianapolis 500. In qualifying everything had gone well, but when Spence took a team-mates car out for a few shakedown laps, he lost control and crashed into the wall. The right-front wheel flew back and struck the drivers head, and poor Spence died in hospital a few hours later.";
383;"Ludovico Scarfiotti";7;18.10.1933;"Турин";;;;;"08.06.1968";"Россфельд, Германия";"A great all-rounder who wasnt out of the top drawer, Scarfiotti nevertheless had his moment of glory in 1966, taking the 3-litre Ferrari to a momentous victory in front of the rapturous tifosi at Monza on a glorious September afternoon. It was the zenith of a career that had started a decade earlier in a far more modest Fiat 1100 saloon. Winning his class in the Mille Miglia in 1956 and 1957, Scarfiotti originally raced just for fun - as he could afford to, being related to the wealthy Agnelli family who, of course, controlled the FIAT empire. He tested a works Ferrari sports car as early as 1958, but had to be content with campaigning a little 2-litre OSCA, taking second place in the Naples GP at Posillipo. 
Ludovico finally joined the Scuderias sports car team in 1960, sharing the fourth-place car with Cabianca and Mairesse in the Targa Florio. His first real success came in 1962 when he took the European mountain-climb championship in Ferraris 2-litre V6 car, and this confirmed his place in the works team for 1963 alongside Surtees and Mairesse, when the rest of the Scuderias drivers were being shown the door. His early-season sports car outings were encouraging. Sharing the 250P with Surtees, he won at Sebring and he later won at Le Mans, this time with Bandini. Impressed with his efforts, Ferrari rewarded him with his Grand Prix debut at Zandvoort and after a steady drive he took sixth place, enough to earn another opportunity at Reims. Unfortunately a practice crash in which he hit a telegraph pole left him with leg injuries serious enough not only to keep him out for some while but also to prompt him to announce his retirement from F1. 
Scarfiotti was back in action in 1964, winning the Nurburgring 1000 Km with Vaccarella in the works Ferrari 275P and finishing second at Mosport in the 330P. Contrary to his earlier intentions, he was back in a Ferrari single-seater at Monza, but was mostly used by the Scuderia in sports cars the following year. Driving the lovely 1.6-litre Ferrari Dino, Ludovico took his second mountain-climb championship, and he was also second in the Monza 1000 Km. 
The 1966 season was his best, but only courtesy of his famous Italian GP victory, as little else was achieved bar a second place in the Nurburgring 1000 Km. Scarfiotti was one of four drivers (Bandini, Parkes and newcomer Amon were the others) representing Ferrari in 1967, and the season started well with second places with the Ferrari P4 sports car at Daytona and in the Monza 1000 Km. Then came a fifth place in the Race of Champions and a staged dead-heat with Parkes to win the Syracuse GP before the first disaster. Bandini was killed at Monaco and soon Parkes - with whom Scarfiotti had just taken a second place at Le Mans – was badly injured at Spa. Lulu seemed to lose heart and after a dispute with the management took his leave, appearing in Dan Gurneys Eagle at Monza. 
For 1968 Scarfiotti found himself a berth at Cooper. The cars were slow but reliable, and he managed to pick up a couple of fourth-place finishes. Although he had forsaken Ferrari, his sports car talents were not about to be allowed to go to waste, and he signed for Porsche to race their prototypes. A second place in the BOAC 500 at Brands was to be his best placing for the Stuttgart firm, for while practising for the Rossfeld hill-climb in June 1968 he inexplicably ran straight on at a corner and crashed into a clump of trees with fatal consequences.";

The young Bianchi nurtured hopes of a competition career, and in fact shared a Lancia with Claes in the 1955 Liege-Rome-Liege Rally, taking third place in what proved to be the terminally ill Claes last event. Gradually Bianchi began to build his career in both sports cars and rallying, taking a class win with a Ferrari at Le Mans in 1957, and the first of three Tour de France rally wins (1957, 1958 and 1964). 
Joining Equipe Nationale Beige, Lucien scored a third place at Pau in 1959, and a fourth the following year in the non-title South African GP, but the Belgian team was hardly front rank, and most of his success during this period was in sports cars, Bianchi winning the 1960 Paris 1000 Km with Gendebien in ENBs Ferrari, and the Sebring 12 Hours and the Angola GP in 1962. 
Between 1963 and 1967, Formula 1 opportunities practically dried up, but Lucien busied himself in virtually every other form of competition - sports car and GT racing, Formula 2 (taking second on aggregate at Zolder in 1964) and Formula 3 as well as selected rallies. A reliable endurance racer, Bianchi became much in demand, driving works Porsches and Fords on occasion in addition to his regular seat in the Equipe Nationale Beige, while the 1967 season saw him try his hand at the Indianapolis 500. Having comfortably posted a good qualifying time, he flew back to race in the Nurburgring 1000 Km for Porsche, where an electrical failure on the last lap cost him the race win and dropped him to fourth place. Afterwards he was given the news that he had been bumped from the grid at Indy. 
Bianchi found a regular Grand Prix drive at last in 1968, albeit in the fading Cooper team, and scored points in his first two races. However, he enjoyed his best-ever sports car season, winning the Le Mans 24 Hours with Rodriguez and the Watkins Glen 6 Hours with Ickx for John Wyer, and taking the Circuit of Mugello in a works Alfa Romeo. At the end of the year Bianchi took part in the London-Sydney Marathon, and his Citroen was in a seemingly unassailable lead, less than 100 miles from the finish, when the car was involved in an accident with a non-competing vehicle while his co-driver Ogier was at the wheel, leaving Lucien with a broken ankle and shock. 
Recovered from this crushing disappointment, Bianchi signed for Autodelta to race their Alfa T33s, but while practising at the Le Mans test weekend he lost control on the Mulsanne Straight. The car veered across the track into a telegraph pole, disintegrated and burst into flames, and the luckless Bianchi was killed instantly.";

He tried the current French vogue of monomill racing in 1954, but his serious competition activities were then put on hold for three years while he was working in Madagascar. Back in Europe in 1957, he finished second in the Liege-Rome-Liege Rally with a Mercedes, which he soon replaced with a Ferrari 250 GT, but success did not really come until 1960 when he took second in class at the Nurburgring 1000 Km, and second overall in the Rouen GP. This was in contrast to his rather disappointing year in a Formula 2 Cooper, a sixth place at Syracuse his only result worth mentioning. His 1961 season was curtailed by a very big accident during the practice days at Le Mans which left him with a badly broken arm and leg, but he was back in action the following year with a Formula Junior Brabham, putting in some superb drives to become one of the formulas leading protagonists. 
The advent of the 1 -litre Formula 2 in 1964 gave Jo the chance to pit himself against some of racings top names, and he became a respected member of the Continental F2 fraternity, joining the Matra works team in 1966 and running the same car under the Ford France banner the following season before setting up a team with his great friend Guy Ligier to race McLarens in 1968. Since 1965 Schlesser had also made something of name for himself at the wheel of powerful sports cars including a Shelby Cobra and then the Ford France GT40, winning the Reims 12-hour race in 1967, paired with Ligier. 
However, his Grand Prix experience was limited to just two outings in the Formula 2 class of the German GP when he was invited to race the totally unproven air-cooled Honda in the 1968 French GP - it must be said, much against the wishes of John Surtees. In the opening laps of the race, Schlesser lost control of the car in pouring rain, crashing it into an earth bank, whereupon it burst into flames, swiftly claiming the life of its 41-year-old driver.";

He was soon beating his father (a former 250 cc German speedway champion and accomplished national car racer), notching up a dozen wins by the end of 1959. After a rather barren 1960 season with a Formula Junior Cooper, Kurt made amends the following year, defeating Gerhard Mitter to win the German Formula Junior championship, a feat which he repeated in 1963 after returning from a six-month suspension imposed by the ONS for disputing the official result of a race the previous year. 
The acquisition of a Brabham in 1965 provided him with the opportunity to race in both F3 and F2 but his outings in the latter category were restricted by his commitments at his fathers garage and scrap metal business. Nevertheless he also found time to race the works Fiat-Abarth on occasion with success. 
Backed by Caltex (who sponsored his only F1 ride in the German GP of that year), he enjoyed a full Formula 2 season in 1968, finishing second in the Eifelrennen and third at both Jarama and Hockenheim, relishing the chance to compete with Grand Prix stars such as Rindt and Stewart. 
Having previously stated his dislike of long-distance racing, it is perhaps surprising that Ahrens chose to opt for this category in 1969, winning the Austrian GP with Jo Siffert in David Pipers Porsche 917.

A typical Australian all-round sportsman, boxer, swimmer and motor cycle ace, Frank took up car racing in 1956-57 when he won 23 out of 24 races in a C-Type Jaguar to become NSW sports car champion. Inevitably he headed for England and found employment not as a driver but as a mechanic, for Aston Martin, Jim Russell and, in 1962, Jack Brabhams newly formed team, working on the Formula Junior cars. He drove the Brabham a few times that year but turned down Jacks offer of a full-time ride for 1963 (taken instead by Denny Hulme), opting to join Ian Walker for a massively successful sports and Formula Junior programme. 
This had established Gardner as a serious proposition, and he moved to John Willments team in 1964 to drive in Formula 2, also handling his stable of powerful sports and saloon cars. Ambitiously, the team went into Formula 1 in 1965, but were just not up to it, though they did take an aggregate fourth place in the Race of Champions. Frank felt he had made a bit of a fool of himself, and gave Grand Prix racing a wide berth except for a couple of drives in 1968. He contested the Tasman series in a Brabham during this period, giving a good account of himself against the likes of Clark, Hill and Stewart, and did more Formula 2 in the MRP Lola and a works Brabham, but really established a niche in saloon cars, taking a string of championships from 1968 with Alan Manns Escort into the seventies with both the Ford Mustang and Chevrolet Camaro. In fact Gardner seemed to be racing virtually every weekend, as he was also contesting F5000 in the works Lola, taking the championship in both 1971 and 72, before suddenly quitting single-seaters after the Tasman series early in 1973 (I drove like an old woman was Franks over-critical assessment, having won one round and taken three second places). 
He continued to thunder on in the Camaro, until returning to his native land to race in the sports sedan championships, inevitably winning the title in 1976 and 77. Frank Gardner was truly a racing driver in the very best sense of the word.";

In 1962 he arranged to drive a Bowmaker Lola in the non-championship F1 race there, but he rejected the car in practice, claiming it was not satisfactory. From then on he found the cars he drove acceptable, but was unable to score any worthwhile results, despite some excellent qualifying performances, which included seventh fastest for the 1967 United States Grand Prix. 
Most of his sorties outside Mexico were across the border in USRRC races, but he did come to Europe once to race a Lotus 48 F2 car at the Madrid GP in 1967, when he finished eleventh.

391;"Bob Anderson";1;19.5.1931;"Хендон, Северный Лондон";;;;;"14.08.1967";"Нортгемптон";"This tough ex-motor cycle racer had tasted success before a damaged back ended his two-wheel career and he switched to four-wheel competition at the relatively late age of 29 in 1961. A season was spent learning the ropes in Formula Junior for Lotus before he bought the ex-Bowmaker Lola to have a crack at Formula 1 in 1963, competing in the many non-title races that abounded at the time. After a third place at Imola and a fourth at Syracuse, he won the Rome GP against fairly thin local opposition, quickly garnering the experience to compete full-time in the World Championship in 1964. 
Making the absolute most of a minute budget, he frequently outdrove more vaunted competitors with his Brabham and was deservedly awarded the Wolfgang von Trips Trophy for the best private entrant. The days of the independent were already numbered but Bob - loyally supported by his French wife Marie-Edmee - ploughed on. His 1965 season was cut short after he wrote off his car in a practice accident at the Nurburgring, but this setback merely strengthened Andersons resolve and he equipped his Brabham with an old Climax four-cylinder engine for the new 1966 3-litre formula. 
Once again heroic performances gained placings which reflected the drivers skill and tenacity but as the Cosworth era dawned even Bob was facing the stark reality that time was up for the impecunious privateer. Testing his ancient Brabham on a wet track at Silverstone in preparation for the 1967 Canadian GP, he aquaplaned into a marshals post, receiving severe throat and chest injuries. Poor Anderson had no chance of survival, and eventually succumbed four hours later in Northampton hospital. 
Seen as a lone wolf, Anderson would have loved to be considered for a works drive but, while the Grand Prix circus wined and dined at the plushest of hotels on their travels, Bob was to be found resting his head in less expensive establishments - if there was time for sleep at all, given his other duties as team manager, mechanic and public relations man. 
Today, the sometimes abrasive Anderson is a forgotten figure, but those who knew him remember a man of remarkable integrity and indomitable spirit who lived - and died - for his passion.";

Less than three weeks later he made his only appearance in a Grand Prix at Kyalami but spent many laps in the pits after a collision at the start. 
Botha took a step up in competitiveness after adding a Repco engine to his BT11, and finished third behind Charlton and Love in the Rand Autumn Trophy at Kyalami. However, his inexperience was soon apparent and, though showing a fair turn of speed, he had a number of offs in the next few events. Sadly, he crashed again in a race in Mozambique, his car killing eight spectators. Botha escaped personal injury but never raced again.";
393;"Lorenzo Bandini";7;21.12.1935;"Барcе, Cиренаика, Ливия";;;;;"10.05.1967";"Монте-Карло, Монако";"With such a name, he just had to be an Italian racing driver, though as a personality he didnt fit the stereotype, being calm and possessed of an even temperament and a pleasant disposition. Bandini worked as a garage mechanic for a Signor Freedi, who was later to become 
his father-in-law, before setting up on his own in Milan. Dreaming of nothing but racing, he worked assiduously, until beginning his racing career tentatively with Fiats and later a Lancia Appia Zagato, in which he won his class in the 1958 Mille Miglia Rally. Later that year he bought a Volpini Formula Junior and finished third on aggregate on his debut in the Sicilian Gold Cup at Syracuse. 
Bandini began the 1959 season with his own machine, but was quickly taken into the works Stanguellini team where he was soon a leading runner, winning the Liberty GP in Cuba at the beginning of 1960, and later taking the Pescara GP ahead of Denny Hulme. Already yearning for more powerful machinery, Lorenzo was fortunate to come under the wing of Signor Mimmo Dei, of the Scuderia Centro Sud, who put him into his Formula 1 Cooper for 1961. An early-season third place at the Pau GP was a splendid start, but Bandini was soon in the shadow of Giancarlo Baghetti, who had been given the FISA-backed Ferrari in preference to Lorenzo, and was about to enjoy his brief spell of fame. Much was made in the press of the rivalry between the two young Italians, but in fact there was no friction, as they were good friends. Bandini raced on in the Cooper without much success, but took a superb win in the sports car Pescara GP before the season was out. 
In 1962 Bandini was invited to join the Ferrari team at last, but it was a season of disarray at Maranello, with drivers chosen for races on a seemingly ad hoc basis. Nevertheless he finished a cool third at the Monaco GP, and in non-title races he took fifth place at Pau and second at Naples and won the Mediterranean GP at Enna. Amazingly he was dropped from the F1 team in favour of Mairesse for 1963, so it was back to Centro Sud to race their newly acquired BRM, while continuing in the Ferrari sports car squad. After a second place in the Targa Florio, Bandini then shared a Ferrari 250P with Scarfiotti to win Le Mans and later took second in the Reims 12 Hours with Surtees. This success stood him in good stead, and after Mairesse was injured Lorenzo returned to the fold. 
Largely due to the efforts of Surtees, the team were on their way back, and in 1964 Bandini was the Englishmans number two, accepting his position stoically and scoring his first, and only, Grand Prix victory at the bumpy Zeltweg airfield circuit, when more fancied runners failed. The final 1.5-litre season in 1965 was relatively uneventful and, though Bandinis position in the team remained the same, he was increasingly unhappy with the status quo and relations with Surtees were becoming a little strained. In sports cars, Ferraris programme was limited, but Lorenzo won the Targa Florio with Vaccarella. The friction in the team continued into 1966, and Bandini drove the 2.4-litre Dino into second place at Monaco, even though Surtees wanted to race the car. The situation could not last and when Surtees quit Maranello, Bandini suddenly found himself leading the team. A certain win in the French GP was lost when a throttle cable snapped, and Scarfiotti and Parkes took the honours at Monza when he encountered fuel feed problems. 
The 1967 season started well with victories in the Daytona 24 Hours and Monza 1000 Km in a Ferrari 330P4 shared with newcomer Chris Amon, and then second place in the Race of Champions behind Gurneys Eagle. The next race in which he competed was his favourite, the Monaco Grand Prix. Qualifying second on the grid, Bandini led in the early stages before dropping behind Denny Hulmes Brabham. Late in the race, however, he made a charge in a bid for victory. On the 82nd lap he clipped the chicane entering the harbour front, rolling the Ferrari, which burst into flames upside down in the middle of the track. The rescue crew were terribly slow to react and the ill-fated driver, dreadfully burnt and injured, lay trapped for what seemed an eternity. Broken and charred, he was eventually dragged from the foam-covered wreck and rushed to hospital. There was no prospect of recovery for poor Bandini and, mercifully perhaps, he passed away after clinging on to life for three days.";
394;"Richie Ginther";24;5.8.1930;"Голливуд, Калифорния";;;;;"20.09.1989";"Тузак-ле-Руку, Бордо, Франция";"Small and freckle-faced, Richie Ginther was always just outside the top echelon of Grand Prix talent but on his day he was more than capable of delivering the goods. In many ways he was the perfect number two driver, being conscientious, reliable and an extremely fine tester, with a rare mechanical sympathy born of his early days as a mechanic on both cars and aeroplanes during his National Service. 
Although he had run an MG in 1951, it was two years later that he really became involved in serious competition when he shared Phil Hills Ferrari in the Carrera Panamericana. The pair were lucky to emerge unscathed from a crash which wrote off the car, but returned the following year to take second place behind Magliolis works entry. 
Richie then found employment with Ferrari importer Johnnie von Neumann, who gave him plenty of drives over the next few seasons, Ginther making a big name for himself in West Coast racing and coming to the attention of Luigi Chinetti, who in turn entered him in his Ferraris, Richies programme including a visit to Le Mans in 1957. Combining his job running the car agency with a racing career was becoming something of a strain, but after he shared a Ferrari sports car with von Trips to take second place in the Buenos Aires 1000 Km, Ginther was offered a four-race contract by the Scuderia. He quit his job and took the opportunity, moving to Italy with his wife. Although the sports car races yielded no success, his single-seater rides were a revelation. He was second in the Modena GP in the front-engined F2 car and made three Grand Prix starts, finishing an impressive sixth at Monaco in the rear-engined prototype, and second at Monza in the boycotted Italian GP. Quickly realising his tremendous engineering expertise, Ferrari gave Richie the role of chief development driver in addition to his racing duties. In 1961 the team virtually swept the board with their sharknose 156 V6 car and Ginther really impressed with his spirited pursuit of Stirling Moss at Monaco. Surprisingly he found himself surplus to requirements at the end of the year but BRM were more than willing to bring him into the fold. 
He made an ideal partner to Graham Hill, putting in much hard work as the Bourne team came good at last and won the World Championship. The 1963 season was his most successful and consistent, Ginther scoring points in every Grand Prix bar one to finish equal second with his team-mate in the championship behind runaway winner Jim Clark. Ginther stayed on for a third year in 1964, again proving his mechanical sympathy by finishing every Grand Prix. 
It was all-change for 1965 as Ginther was hired to bring some much-needed experience to the still-fledgling Honda project. As the season wore on the car became a real threat, until Richie had his greatest moment when he won the Mexican Grand Prix at the last race of the year. It must have been galling for all concerned that it marked the end of the 1.5-litre formula, for Honda would have been a very tough act to beat in 1966 under the old rules. As it was they had to start again, and after filling in with a Cooper until the new car was ready towards the end of the season, Ginther was fortunate to escape a huge accident at Monza when a tyre failed. For 1967 Honda went with John Surtees and Richie joined up with Dan Gurney at Eagle. He lay second in the Race of Champions before retiring, but then surprisingly failed to qualify at Monaco. While practising for the Indianapolis 500 he suddenly decided that it was time to quit. Richie became involved in team management roles, for example running a Porsche 911 with Elliot Forbes-Robinson in 1971, before cutting his links with the sport and dropping out of the rat race to live in a camper in the desert. He returned to the circuits in 1977, invited to the German GP at Hockenheim by Goodyear to present the winner, Niki Lauda, with a prize to mark the tyre companys 100th win, though many would not have recognised him with his moustache and long hair replacing the once familiar crew-cut. 
It was a frail and sick Ginther who arrived at Donington in 1989 to attend BRMs 40th anniversary celebrations, and it was with much sadness but little surprise that the racing world learned of his death after a heart attack just days later while holidaying in France.";
395;"Mike  Parkes";1;24.9.1931;"Ричмонд, Суррей";;;;;"28.08.1977";"Рива-Прессо-Кьери, Турин, Италия";"Born into a motoring family (his father was the chairman of Alvis cars), Mike first took to the circuits with an MG TD while working as an engineer with the Rootes group, and soon graduated to a Frazer Nash. 
He started to race seriously in 1957 with a Lotus, bringing an invitation from Colin Chapman to act as reserve driver for the works team at Le Mans, and then became involved with David Frys Formula 2 project, which was intended for Stuart Lewis-Evans. Apart from the occasional Libre success in minor events during 1958-59, the car was not really competitive and Mike failed to qualify it for the F2 class of the British GP at Aintree. 
A few outings in Sir Gawaine Baillies Lotus Elite during 1960 showed his potential but brought little by way of results, but his breakthrough came in 1961 when he raced for Tommy Sopwiths Equipe Endeavour in GT and Formula Junior events, and also handled Maranello Concessionaires Ferrari GT, winning races regularly in all classes. The high point of his season was undoubtedly the Le Mans 24 Hours, in which he shared a Ferrari 3-litre Testa Rossa with Willy Mairesse to take a superb second place. 
Although he began 1962 with a rare Formula 1 outing at Mallory Park, taking fourth place in the 1000 Guineas race in a Bowmaker Cooper, Parkes immediate future remained in the sports and GT category. His superb form of the previous year was repeated with much the same machinery, his tally including a hat-trick of wins in one day at Brands Hatch. Another fine outing brought second place in the Nurburgring 1000 Km in the works Ferrari, and it was no surprise when he joined the Scuderia for the 1963 season as development engineer and reserve driver. 
Over the next three seasons, Mike became one the worlds leading sports car drivers, winning the Sebring 12 Hours and Spa 500 Km in 1964 - a season cut short by a testing accident - and the Monza 1000 Km in 1965. After John Surtees sudden departure from the team, Mike was elevated to Grand Prix status and, with a special long chassis to accommodate his 6 ft 4 in frame, he took second place on his debut in the French GP and repeated the feat at Monza. His success in sports cars continued, Parkes winning the Monza and Spa 1000 Km in 1966, and finishing second at Daytona, Monza and Le Mans in 1967, a season which started with much promise when he dead-heated with Scarfiotti to share a win at Syracuse and then demolished the opposition in the International Trophy at Silverstone. However, disaster struck in the Belgian GP when he crashed his Ferrari and suffered serious leg injuries. 
Mike continued in a management role at Ferrari while he recovered from the accident, and made a tentative return in the Paris 1000 Km in 1969, returning to the track in 1970 and 1971 for NART and Scuderia Filipinetti. Though he could not repeat his previous triumphs, Parkes produced some useful performances, including a superb drive to fifth place in the 1972 Targa Florio with Peter Westbury in the little Lola T212. He was then involved in the Fiat 128 touring car programme before moving to Lancia to help develop the Stratos. Tragically, Parkes was killed in a road accident in 1977 when his car was involved in a collision with a lorry.";

Further success in F3 with the Chequered Flag Merlyn brought him a works Formula 2 drive for that marque in 1965. He then gained a works drive for Brabham in 1966, concentrating on F3 but occasionally racing in F2, and scoring a fine third place in the Albi GP. Given an old four-cylinder-engined Brabham, Chris finished seventh on his GP debut at Brands Hatch, impressing Tim Parnell, who signed him along with Piers Courage to share the semi-works BRM for 1967. 
In fact, Courage made a tardy start to the season, while Irwin, after scoring a fourth at Sandown Park and a third at Longford in the Tasman series, followed by sixth place in the Race of Champions and fourth at Syracuse in Parnells old Lotus 25-BRM, took his chance with some solid and sensible drives in both the 2-litre car and the heavy and unreliable H16, which he took to fifth in the French GP. 
Chris had also joined up with John Surtees to race the works Lola in Formula 2, winning the 1968 Eifelrennen race at the Nurburgring and finishing third at Zolder, before a return to the Ring in Alan Manns Ford PL3 sports car ended in a catastrophic practice crash. Poor Chris received very serious head injuries, from which he eventually made a recovery, but he never raced again.";
397;"Guy  Ligier";10;12.7.1930;"Виши";;;;;"";"";"This uncompromising character came late onto the motor racing scene after a distinguished rugby career. A close friend and business partner of Jo Schlesser, he began racing in 1965 with a Porsche Carrera, then moving into endurance racing with a Porsche 904GT. Ligier competed in Formula 2 in 1964 and gained some minor success in a Brabham BT10, with fifth in the Pergusa GP and sixth places at both Albi and Montlhery. In 1965 he raced a Ford GT, winning the sports and GT race at Albi, but achieving little of note elsewhere. 
Taking delivery of a Cooper-Maserati, he joined the Grand Prix circus in 1966, but his season ended early, Ligier sustaining a smashed knee-cap after crashing in practice for the German GP. Undaunted, he returned in 1967, eventually replacing the Cooper with a more competitive Brabham, and scoring his only championship point at the Nurburgring. He did record a major success in sports cars that year, however, winning the Reims 12 Hours in a Ford GT40 with Schlesser. 
In 1968 Guy returned to Formula 2 but, disillusioned after Schlessers death at Rouen, he quit in mid-season, only to return the following year with the ex-Alan Mann Escort, before building a prototype sports car which he successfully debuted in 1970. This sports car programme eventually led to a Formula 1 machine being built for 1976 and, though the Ligier team often failed to make the most of their resources, the blue cars were a constant presence on the grid until the end of 1996, even though Ligier himself had sold most of his shareholding in 1992-93. 
In 1997 Ligier finally disposed of the remaining 18 per cent of his interest in the team to Flavio Briatore for what amounted to a knock-down price.

Concentrating on Formula 2 between 1964 and 1968, Rees drove countless races in the teams Brabhams, often beating the stars of the day, such as Rindt, Stewart and Clark. However, his Grand Prix opportunities were limited to a couple of races in the Winkelmann F2 car and a single outing in a rather tired works Cooper at the 1967 British GP.

In fact this car was the famous R11 with which the great Scotsman had utterly dominated the 1965 World Championship. The car was fitted with a 2-litre BRM unit for Fisher, who performed quite respectably both in Canada and in practice for the Mexican GP, where he was unfortunate not to start when a diaphragm worth five cents on his fuel metering unit ruptured. 
His racing career was then interrupted by the Vietnam war as Mike entered pilot training in 1968 and flew fighters (including the F-102, F-101, F-4 and F-15) until he was assigned to the Pentagon in 1994.

In searing heat at Reims in 1961, the young Italian showed remarkable racecraft and composure as he took the sole surviving Ferrari to victory over the works Porsche driven by Dan Gurney. It was no fluke, for some weeks earlier Baghetti had done exactly the same thing in his first Formula 1 race at Syracuse and he had then followed that up with another victory, though the field at the Naples GP was weak and Giancarlo had an easy win. No other driver has ever won his first three Formula 1 races and probably none ever will, so Baghettis place in motor racing folklore is secure. 
His racing career started with an Alfa Romeo in 1956 and, after a second place in the Mille Miglia Rally in 1958, driving an Alfa 1900TI, Baghetti turned to sports car and Formula Junior racing over the next two years. He took three wins in the FJ Dragada-Lancia, and was invited to join the Scuderia Sant Ambroeus team who were in turn members of FISA (Federazione Italiane Scuderie Automobilistiche), a body helping to promote young Italian racing talent, the ultimate aim being a place in the Ferrari Formula 1 team. Eventually Baghetti was chosen and, as related above, the early results were sensational, but his subsequent career never matched those dizzy heights. His next race, in the rain at Aintree, ended in a shunt, and Monza brought an engine failure, though he did set fastest lap. In 1962 the Ferrari team were left behind by the V8 opposition and, although Baghetti scored a few decent finishes in Grands Prix and a second place in the Mediterranean GP, he was now being overshadowed by his old Junior rival Bandini, though the pair shared a Ferrari 196 to take second place in the Targa Florio. 
With Ferrari in a state of disarray by the end of the year, Baghetti made a disastrous move (with Phil Hill) to Carlo Chitis breakaway ATS organisation for 1963, and there was to be no Grand Prix salvation when he joined the Centro Sud team with their elderly BRMs. His reputation got him the occasional Grand Prix ride thereafter, but he could still be found in sports cars. He finished second, with Guichet, in the 1966 Targa Florio in a works Ferrari, and was a regular in the European touring car championship with a Fiat Abarth. Surprisingly for one so famous, he was quite happy to drop down into the Italian F3 championship between 1967 and 1968, and he also took a Lancia Fulvia on the London-Sydney marathon but was forced to abandon the trip when his passport and all his documents were stolen in Bombay.

Certainly Jonathan had been amazingly successful in European F3 in 1965-66, but his sojourn at Maranello did his career prospects no favours. A Formula 1 project for Abarth proved abortive, leaving him scratching for rides thereafter. 
He did some Formula 2 in 1968, winning the Rhine Cup race for his old F3 partner Frank Williams, and then raced the works Serenissima and various other privateer sports cars into the early seventies before retiring to pursue a career as a pilot based in the south of France.";

His best result was a fourth place at Le Mans (with Gurney) to win the GT class. 
Bob had a hectic season in 1965, racing the Cobra and Ford GTs, in addition to a number of Formula 2 and Formula 3 outings. This led to an invitation to race the works Ferrari in place of the injured John Surtees at seasons end.

Arundell began his career with an MG TC in 1957 before racing a Lotus XI, and then a Lola sports car, soon becoming the fastest private practitioner behind the works entries. When Peter then won an end-of-season Junior race in the front-engined Elva-DKW, Colin Chapman was not slow to recognise the Essex mans potential and signed him for his Junior team in 1960, a season which saw him beat both his team-mates - Trevor Taylor and Jim Clark - on occasion. As number two to Taylor during 1961, Peter maintained his progress, highlighted by winning the Monaco Junior race, and for 1962 he rightfully assumed the team leadership, dominating proceedings with some brilliant displays, taking 18 wins from 25 starts, and easily claiming the BARC Junior championship. 
In truth he should have been promoted to Formula 1 at this stage, and there would certainly have been a drive for him elsewhere had he chosen to seek it. Instead Peter waited patiently for his opportunity, knowing that a better prospect than a Lotus would be hard to find. So it was more Formula Junior in 1963, with occasional F1 outings merely confirming his talent. A superb drive into second place at the Solitude GP was matched in the Mediterranean GP at Enna, 
Arundells fully deserved promotion finally came in 1964, and the season began in tremendous style, his Grand Prix performances being backed by some equally impressive results in non-championship Formula 1 races. He was second in the News of the World Trophy at Goodwood and third at both the Aintree 200 and the Syracuse GP (shared with Spence). In the newly inaugurated Formula 2, Peter was just as impressive, taking third place at Pau, second in the Grovewood Trophy at Mallory Park and fourth in the London Trophy before the fateful Reims race, when his spinning Lotus was hit broadside by Ginther. The car was smashed into an earth bank and Arundell was hurled from the cockpit, suffering a broken arm, thigh and collarbone and severe concussion. 
His rehabilitation was long and slow, but Chapman promised him a place in the team when fit, and he reappeared at the South African GP on New Years Day in 1966, to take third place in the Lotus 33. Once the season got under way, Peter seemed a shadow of his former self, though, to be fair, the machinery at his disposal hardly gave him a chance to shine. Racing the works Formula 2 car brought only a second place at the Eifelrennen, so when Graham Hill was signed for 1967 Arundell was released. Really that was the end for Peter, though in 1968 he briefly raced Alan Manns Escort before a short spell with the McNamara F3 and Formula Vee projects in 1969.";

With the introduction of the 3-litre formula in 1966, Chris raced a shoestring Cooper-Ferrari special, which he took to fifth place in that years Gold Cup race at Oulton Park. Following the projects demise in 1967, he resurfaced briefly in sports car racing, then worked in France designing road cars, before returning to his beloved Morgans in the early seventies, running a tuning company specialising in that marque.

407;"Trevor  Taylor";1;26.12.1936;"Гледлесс, Шеффилд, Йоркшир";;;;;"";"";"Even this gritty and determined Yorkshireman was eventually battered into submission by a catalogue of crashes which would have frightened a lesser man from the cockpit of a racing car for ever. As it was, he returned from a bombed-out Formula 1 career to later establish himself as a top-line F5000 campaigner, which says a lot for the qualities he possessed. 
The son of a garage proprietor, Trevor was given much encouragement in his early racing days by his father, who bought a Triumph TR2 for him to race in 1955. This was soon replaced by a succession of 500 cc F3 cars, one of them the ex-Lewis-Evans Cooper-Norton. Progress was slow initially, but by 1958 Trevor was good enough to take the British F3 championship. The garage purchased an F2 Cooper for him to race in 1959, but apart from a minor Libre win at Rufforth little of note was achieved. Colin Chapman offered to run Taylor as part of his Junior team in 1960 if he purchased a Lotus 18, and it proved to be a sound decision for both parties. Taylor shared the championship that year with Jim Clark, and was taken into the team proper for 1961, when he again won the title, this time on his own. With Ireland injured at Monaco, Trevor was given his Grand Prix debut at Zandvoort where he finished 13th, and last, in a race unique for its complete lack of a pit stop or retirement. 
There were a few other Formula 1 outings that year, his best results being a second place in the Rand GP at Kyalami, followed by a win in the Cape GP at Killarney early in 1962. By this time Chapman had placed his faith in the youngster, putting him into the Formula 1 team at the expense of Innes Ireland. A second place at Zandvoort was a great start, but he was shaken up at Spa when a duel with Willy Mairesse left both cars wrecked and the Belgian in hospital. This was followed by an 80 mph crash-test into the back of Trintignants stalled car at Rouen which left him bruised from head to foot, and at the Nurburgring he was the victim of an engine malady which sent him through a hedge. His confidence was restored at the end of the year, however, when he shared the winning car in the Mexican GP with Clark and then won the Natal GP at Westmead. 
Retained for 1963, Taylor took second places at Pau and Karlskoga, but apart from a single point at Monaco was out of luck in championship events. The Mediterranean GP at Enna supplied perhaps Taylors most astounding escape, when he was pitched from his Lotus at over 100 mph, rolling some 50 yards down the circuit as his car hurtled to destruction. Amazingly he emerged with just grazes and bruising. With Peter Arundell knocking at the door, Taylor was released to join the BRP team in 1964, but apart from a sixth place at Watkins Glen there was little to enthuse about in the performances of the pale-green cars. Trevor raced a Brabham in Formula 2 during 1965-66, and was briefly involved in the amateurish Shannon project, which represented the nadir of his career. From 1967 he went back to basics, first running a Lotus 47 with encouraging results before moving up to a Lola T70 to win the 1969 Tourist Trophy at Oulton Park. This was the inaugural year of F5000, and Trevor took his Surtees TS5 right to the brink of a championship win before losing out to Peter Gethin after the pair collided in the final round at Brands Hatch. Trevor continued in the formula throughout the next three seasons, always a competitive proposition but never quite the force of that first year. At the end of 1972 he brought the curtain down on a sometimes unlucky career, but the fact that he had emerged intact after some of those early mishaps was probably cause enough for him to count his blessings.";

A talented driver in the Italian lower formulae, he also participated in 3 Formula One Italian Grands Prix from 1964–66, failing to qualify for the 1964 race, driving a Brabham for Rob Walker. For his two Grand Prix starts, he drove for Team Lotus. He scored no championship points.
However, he was a four-time Italian F3 series champion, winning consecutive championships from 1961 to 1964.
He was killed in a horrific accident in an Italian Formula 3 race at Caserta in 1967. After a multiple accident involving Ernesto Brambilla, Clay Regazzoni, Jurg Dubler, Romano Tiger Perdomi and Corrado Manfredini; another driver, Beat Fehr, stopped his car, got out and ran down the track to warn the oncoming racers of the damaged cars on the track ahead.

409;"Phil Hill";24;20.4.1927;"Майами, Флорида";;;;;"28.08.2008";"Монтерей, Калифорния";"Phil Hill is always remembered as the man who became Americas first World Champion when he took the crown driving a Ferrari in 1961, yet that season he won only two Grands Prix and they were his only victories in small-capacity racing cars. In a long career he was overwhelmingly more effective and successful in big, powerful sports machines. 
After business studies on the west coast, Phil decided he preferred working on cars to the office life and by 1950 he was racing an MG TC, which was duly replaced by a succession of machines all of which were hard-earned by the sweat of his brow. In 1952 he got a big break with a drive in Alan Guibersons Ferrari, taking sixth place in the Carrera Panamericana, but the following year he fared badly and briefly considered retirement. He was persuaded to continue, however, and second place in the 1954 Carrera was a marvellous morale-booster. His career then took off in a big way Stateside, Phil winning the 1955 SCCA championship, and after he had finished second in the 1956 Buenos Aires 1000 Km he was given a contract to drive sports cars for the Scuderia. He won the Swedish GP and the Messina 5 Hours that season in works cars, and added more good results the following year, including a win in the Venezuelan GP at Caracas with Peter Collins. 
By 1958 Phil was itching to get his hands on a Grand Prix car, but Ferrari seemed unwilling to give him the opportunity he craved, save for a little practice at the Libre Buenos Aires GP. Enzo felt he was best suited to sports cars, and Hill proved as much when he won at Buenos Aires and Sebring and then put in a brilliant drive in the wet to win Le Mans with Gendebien. However, by now his need to race in Formula 1 bordered on the obsessional and he hired Bonniers Maserati to give himself a debut at the French GP. Perhaps Ferrari took the hint because come the German GP Hill was handed the teams F2 car, and then at Monza he was entrusted with the real thing - a Ferrari 246 - taking third and fastest lap. By backing off at the finish of the Moroccan GP to allow Hawthorn to move into second place and thus take the championship, Phil did his standing no harm and he became a full-time Grand Prix team member thereafter. He spent 1959 learning the art of Grand Prix driving, sometimes proving a little ragged in his approach and indulging in some hairy moments, but taking fourth place in the championship nevertheless. By 1960 the big front-engined cars were almost on the point of obsolescence, but Hill gave the dinosaurs one last hurrah by winning the rather hollow Italian GP held on Monzas banked circuit which was boycotted by the British teams. 
The following season was to be his finest. In addition to winning the Sebring 12 Hours and Le Mans for the second time with Gendebien, he took the little shark-nose Ferrari to victory at Spa and Monza to be crowned as World Champion in the saddest of circumstances following the terrible death of his team-mate and championship rival Wolfgang von Trips. Things progress quickly in Formula 1, however, and in 1962 Ferrari were totally eclipsed, leaving Phil with a few placings but no hope of defending his title. He was still regarded as one of the finest exponents of sports car racing, however, and confirmed it by winning Le Mans for the third time with Gendebien, as well as the Nurburgring 1000 Km. 
Such was the disharmony at Maranello that year that Phil joined what was effectively a breakaway group to race the ATS in 1965. To say it was a disastrous move would be an understatement, and it effectively destroyed his Grand Prix career. Initially left without a drive, he was called into the Cooper team following the tragic loss of Tim Mayer at Longford, but it was an unhappy liaison, with Phils confidence hitting rock bottom at Zeltweg where he wrote off two cars. This resulted in the ignominy of his being dropped for Monza, but he was reinstated for the final two races. 
Save for a drive in Gurneys Eagle at Monza in 1966, his Grand Prix career was done, but he still had something left. He had been a key member of the Ford works sports car effort in 1964-65, but a move to Jim Halls Chaparral team gave the twilight of his career a final glow. In 1966 he won the Nurburgring 1000 Km with Bonnier, and a Can-Am round at Laguna Seca, and in his final season he took a memorable victory at Brands Hatch sharing the Chaparral 2F with Mike Spence. 
After this last win he drifted into contented retirement, restoring vintage cars and keeping in touch with the sport in a commentary role. Currently he is a regular participant in historic events and no doubt watches with satisfaction the promising progress of his son Derek in the junior formulae.";
410;"Innes Ireland";1;12.6.1930;"Майтолройд, Тодморден, Йоркшир";;;;;"22.10.1993";"Ридинг, Беркшир";"It was all-change; the front-engined cars were out, as was the casual racing attire and devil-may-care attitude, but Innes carried the spirit of a fast-disappearing age into the sixties and in career terms it was to cost him dear. 
The son of a veterinary surgeon, he showed no inclination to follow the same path and instead took up an engineering apprenticeship. After dabbling in racing between 1952 and 1955, a period which saw him complete his National Service as a paratrooper, Innes really got his racing career into gear with a Lotus XI in 1956. He began to build his reputation in 1957 and 1958, racing both his own car and the Ecurie Ecosse Jaguar D-Type. A class win in the Lotus at the Reims 12 Hours impressed Colin Chapman sufficiently for him to sign Innes for the 1959 season, and he took a fourth place in the International Trophy before making an impressive Grand Prix debut at Zandvoort. The cars were very unreliable, and little else was achieved until the 1960 season when the new rear-engined Lotus 18 proved sensationally quick. On its debut in Argentina, Ireland led comfortably until the gear linkage broke, and then at home he stormed to victory in the Glover Trophy at Goodwood, ahead of Moss, and the International Trophy, putting Brabham in his place. Although a Grand Prix victory was not to be his that season, Innes enjoyed a fabulous year, for in addition to the wins previously mentioned he took the Lombank Trophy and recorded some excellent placings as well as Formula 2 wins at Goodwood and Oulton Park. 
The 1961 season started badly for Innes with a heavy crash at Monaco when he selected the wrong gear, but despite a fractured kneecap he was soon back in his stride, producing a splendid performance to win the Solitude GP, followed by a win in the Flugplatzrennen at Zeltweg. His great moment arrived at the end of the season when he won the US GP after a text book drive. Much to his chagrin, Ireland was then released from his contract by Chapman, who had decided that youngsters Jim Clark and Trevor Taylor would race for him in 1962. It was effectively the end of Innes front-line career. Joining the UDT-Laystall team, he found success in sports cars, winning the Tourist Trophy in a 250 GTO, but endured a largely frustrating time in single-seaters. He won the Crystal Palace Trophy in 1962 and the following season (the team having been renamed BRP) he enjoyed a respectable early-season run in non-championship events with both a Lotus 24 and the teams own BRP chassis, winning the Glover Trophy and finishing third at Snetterton, second at Aintree, fourth at Silverstone and third at Solitude, before an accident at Seattle left him with a dislocated hip. 
In 1964 Innes plugged away with the disappointing BRP, claiming a victory in the Daily Mirror Trophy at Snetterton, but the team closed its doors at the end of the year, leaving Ireland to find a berth in the Parnell Racing team for 1965. His off-track popularity was as high as ever, but sadly he was by then less than reliable as a driver. Appearing late for a practice session in Mexico saw him dismissed on the spot, but Tim Parnell must have forgiven him as he raced for the team again in the 1966 South African GP! Innes then found employment racing sports cars, sharing a Ford GT40 with Amon to take fifth place in the Spa 1000 Km. He drew down the curtain on his single-seater career late in 1966 when he joined Bernard Whites suitably happy-go-lucky equipe and took fourth place in the Gold Cup at Oulton Park, before his last two Grand Prix appearances in the US and Mexico. His hell-raising lifestyle had not fitted in with the new professionalism of the age, but this unique character, who could both charm and outrage in short order, continued to be happily associated with the sport in both journalistic and organisational capacities on and off until his death from cancer in 1993.";
411;"Ronnie Bucknum";24;5.4.1936;"Алхамбра, Калифорния";;;;;"14.04.1992";"Сан-Луис-Обиспо, Калифорния";"Although Bucknum had been competing in sports cars in America since 1957, his selection by Honda to spearhead their 1964 Grand Prix challenge was strange indeed. His lack of international racing pedigree had its attractions for the secretive Japanese, since Ronnie could test and race the car without raising undue attention or expectations, and the opposition would never really know just how well it was progressing in that first season. However, the novice did well just to survive a daunting debut at the Nurburgring which ended when the car suffered a steering failure. 
Two more races were safely completed before the team signed the vastly more experienced Richie Ginther to head their 1965 challenge and embarked on a winter of testing at Suzuka, during which the unlucky Bucknum again suffered a steering failure, crashed and this time broke his leg. This set him back when the season began and he predictably played second fiddle to his team-mate, although he did score points with a fifth place in Mexico as Ginther swept aside the opposition to record Hondas first Grand Prix win. 
If nothing else, everybody now knew who Ronnie Bucknum was and he was invited to join the Ford team for 1966, finishing third at Le Mans with Hutcherson. Honda still thought well of their man and once two of their 3-litre cars were available he returned for the end-of-season American races. Although this was his final bow in Grands Prix, in many ways Bucknums career as a racing driver was really just beginning. After more sports cars in 1967, Ronnie went racing in Can-Am and USAC the following year, sensationally winning at Michigan in only his second oval race with an Eagle. Subsequently he raced sports and Trans-Am cars for Roger Penske and teamed up with Sam Posey in the NART Ferrari in long-distance events in the early seventies, by which time the Marine crew-cut had been replaced by collar-length hair and a beard! Bucknum, who was later to suffer from diabetes, died at the comparatively young age of 57 in April 1992.";

He found employment in the Healey factory in 1960, with an opportunity to race their Sprites. This led to two happy seasons with Ian Walkers sports car and Formula Junior team, before he was tempted to join John Willment in 1964 to race all sorts of cars, taking an aggregate second place in the Rand GP and winning the Rhodesian GP in an F2 Brabham, the same car that he used to make his GP debut in South Africa in 1965. 
Back in Europe, Paul had an unproductive time in Dickie Stoops Lotus 33, which he spectacularly crashed into the harbour at Monaco, but he won the F2 Eifelrennen in an Alexis. Apart from a few F1 races with Tim Parnell early in 1966, Hawkins turned his attention to sports cars, which offered him a better opportunity to show his talent. Racing his own Ford GT40, he achieved numerous excellent wins and countless placings during 1967 and 68, with his trips to South Africa proving particularly fruitful, and was also in demand by the top sports car teams of the period as a freelance, winning the 1967 Targa Florio for Porsche and the 1967 Paris 1000 Km and the 1968 Monza 1000 Km for John Wyer. 
With his Lola T70 run from the factory, Hawkeye embarked on a season of sports car racing in 1969 and it was a terrible blow for the sport when this no-nonsense character lost his life after crashing into a tree during the Tourist Trophy race at Oulton Park.";

He returned in 1960 to race a variety of machines, finishing third in the Vanwall Trophy in a Cooper, and doing well in the Formula Junior Gemini. 
His big break came in 1961, when Ken Tyrrell signed him for a season of Formula Junior with his Cooper, young Tony winning eight races and sharing the European FJ title with Jo Siffert. He also made a steady start in Grand Prix racing with Louise Bryden-Browns Lotus 18, impressing the Cooper team, who signed him as number two to Bruce McLaren. 
Always consistent, Maggs scored some fine placings over the next two seasons in a team that was slowly losing its competitive edge, but he was not retained for 1964 and joined up with Centro Sud to race their elderly BRM cars, even getting among the points on two occasions. With no real F1 prospects in sight, Maggs undertook a programme of Formula 2 in an MRP Lola and sports cars in David Pipers Ferrari GTO, the pair winning the Rand 9 Hours at Kyalami. 
After handling Parnells Lotus in the 1965 South African GP, Maggs raced abroad for the last time, taking second place in the Rome GP and fourth at both Oulton Park and Pau in MRPs F2 Lola, and third place in the Sebring 12 Hours with Piper in his Ferrari 250LM.

David raced in European F2 from 1964 to 1967 with little success, but found more joy in sports cars, particularly with the Lotus 30. In 1968-69, he raced his Ford GT40 and then a Lola T70, before becoming a regular competitor in Formula 5000 in 1970 with a McLaren 10B which he then took to the non-championship 1971 Argentine GP to claim a lucrative fourth place on aggregate after more fancied runners had fallen by the wayside.

Trevor did well (second at Nogaro and Caserta) until the money ran out, so he then returned home to contest the South African championships - and his only Grand Prix - in the ex-Love Cooper. 
Blokdyk was back in Europe once more in 1965 to race in F3, when he was one of that seasons star performers until a massive crash at Albi hospitalised him for three months with pelvic and leg injuries.

This achievement proved to be a double-edged sword, however, for he was classed as a graded driver and was therefore not eligible to score points in Formula Junior or national races outside South Africa. 
Neville stayed at home in 1963, dominating his domestic series with a string of wins in his Lotus 21, until a practice accident at the Rand 9 Hours sports car race left him sidelined with a broken leg. He missed that years Grand Prix and also the 1964 Springbok series, after his injury proved very slow to heal.

A trip to Europe saw Doug initially purchase a Cooper T51 from Alan Brown, and further machines ordered from the factory were soon to follow, including the lowline T53 which provided the inspiration for his own LDS Mk2 of 1961. Powered by an Alfa Romeo engine, this was just one of a gradually evolving series of cars that were developed during the early sixties, later models being based upon Brabham designs (much to the chagrin of Jack Brabham). They were driven, for the most part, by Serrurier himself and another veteran, Rhodesian star Sam Tingle. 
By 1966 it was becoming increasingly impractical to compete with the major constructors so, after sharing Roy Pierpoints Lola T70 to take second place in the Cape Town 3 Hours, Serrurier decided to buy one of these cars, which he then shared with Jackie Pretorious, winning the Roy Hesketh 3 Hours in 1967. After more or less retiring from racing at the end of 1969, Serrurier entered Pretorious in the South African F1 series with a Surtees, but still had occasional road and rally outings himself as well as trying his hand at powerboat racing.

In the early days he was hairy but very fast, particularly when he received his Allard J2X and then the even more powerful C-Type Jaguar. His US exploits in this car led to an offer to drive in the 1954 Buenos Aires 1000 Km, and although his outing ended in retirement the trip was still worthwhile, for he purchased the race-winning 4.5-litre Ferrari, which he then brought over to Europe. In his first race, paired with the veteran Biondetti, Gregory finished fourth in the Reims 12 Hours, and the season was to be a fruitful one, with third place in the Portuguese GP, second in class at the Tourist Trophy and a win in the Nassau Trophy. More success followed in the next two seasons, before Masten took the plunge into Grand Prix racing with Scuderia Centro Sud in 1957. Having already shared the winning works Ferrari in the Argentine 1000 Km, Gregory took a brilliant third place on his Grand Prix debut at Monaco and later scored points at both Monza and Pescara. He stayed with the Maserati for 1958, but the car was past its best. 
Masten then negotiated a works drive with Cooper as number three to Jack Brabham and Bruce McLaren for 1959, and despite his position in the team he gave some excellent performances, finishing third at Zandvoort and second at Monsanto, as well as producing a great drive at AVUS. However, after bailing out of his Tojeiro-Jaguar in the Tourist Trophy at Goodwood when the steering failed, Gregory sustained rib and shoulder injuries which caused him to miss the seasons remaining Grands Prix and he found his services were not retained by Cooper for 1960. He was irked at this, to say the least, and returned to Scuderia Centro Sud to race their Maserati-engined Coopers, but enjoyed little luck. 
In 1961 Masten became involved with the American Camoradi outfit, running a Cooper in F1 and a Maserati in sports car racing. He won the Nurburgring 1000 Km in the Birdcage Maserati with Casner, but in mid-season moved over to the UDT-Laystall team to race the more competitive Lotus 18. He continued with the team in 1962, partnered by Innes Ireland, and gained a victory in the minor Kanonloppet F1 race at Karlskoga in the Lotus, and a win in the Players 200 at Mosport with a Lotus 19 sports car, but achieved little else. 
The next few seasons saw his Grand Prix career draw to a close with less and less competitive machinery, but there were compensations, including an unexpected triumph at Le Mans with Rindt in the NART Ferrari, which suddenly opened up a whole new career for Masten back in sports cars.

In 1961-62 he raced mainly in Formula Junior, before buying the Gilby-BRM from Syd Greene to race in Formula 1 in 1963. Ian gained a third place at Vallelunga in the Rome GP, but precious little else, and in 1964-65 he relied on a Brabham BT3, still no more than making up the numbers.

430;"Maurice  Trintignant";10;30.10.1917;"Сент-Сесиль-ле-Винь, Воклюз";;;;;"";"";"Морис был младшим из пяти сыновей зажиточного владельца виноградника и, по примеру троих своих братьев, увлекся автогонками. Несмотря на смерть Луи в Пероне в 1933 г., он не смог устоять перед желанием пять лет спустя сесть за руль спортивного Bugatti, принадлежавшего его несчастному брату. На Гран При По он занял пятое место, а в 1939 г. одержал победу на Гран При де Фронтир в Шимэ, после чего война прервала на время его гоночную деятельность. После войны Тринтиньян вывел свой верный Bugatti на первую же гонку, проводившуюся в Булонском лесу. К сожалению, у машины внезапно возникли проблемы с подачей топлива; как выяснилось позднее, причиной тому были крысы, забравшиеся в бак автомобиля, пока тот вынужденно простаивал в годы войны, и забившие бензопровод продуктами своей жизнедеятельности. Это стало причиной всеобщего веселья, а к Морису с тех пор приклеилось прозвище Le Petoulet («Какашка»), к которому он, впрочем, относился весьма незлобиво. 
Вскоре он сменил Bugatti на Amilcar, одержал на нем победу в Авиньоне в 1947 г., и, проведя половину сезона за рулем Delage в команде Gersac, перешел в Simca Gordini. Сезон 1948 года начался с побед в Перпиньяне и Монлери, но затем был серьезно травмирован на печально известном Гран При Швейцарии в Бремгартене, в ходе которого погибли три гонщика. Морису повезло больше. Его выбросило из развернувшегося автомобиля на самую середину трассы, и только молниеносная реакция приближавшихся Фарины, Биры и Манзона помогла им миновать распростертое тело лежавшего без сознания француза и избежать столкновения между собой. В больнице Морис провел восемь дней в коме, и жизнь его висела на волоске. В какой-то момент его даже объявили умершим, но пульс вернулся, и началось медленное выздоровление. Он вернулся в гонки в начале 1949 г. в составе Simca и стал победителем Circiut des Ramparats в Ангулеме. Казалось, последствия той аварии исчезли без следа; Тринтиньян остался в Gordini до конца сезона 1953 г., приведя маленький бледно-голубой автомобиль в победам в Женеве в 1950 г., в Альби и Кадуре в 1951 и снова в Кадуре в 1953 – в том же году он был провозглашен чемпионом Франции по автогонкам. Увы, машины Gordini славились своей ненадежностью, и все, чего ему удалось добиться в чемпионате мира по гонкам Больших призов – это три финиша на пятом месте. 
После победы на Гран При Буэнос-Айреса за рулем Ferrari Розье большую часть сезона 1954 г. он провел в заводской команде, что не замедлило сказаться на улучшении результатов. Регулярно участвуя в соревнованиях чемпионата мира, Тринтиньян выиграл гонки Ф1 в Каене и Руане, а в Сиракузах и Бари был вторым. Помимо этого, вместе с Гонзалесом он одержал победу в 24 часах Ле-Мана за рулем 4,9-литровой Ferrari. В 1955 г. в Монако спокойный, уверенный пилотаж привел его к первой победе в чемпионате мира, а в гонках спортивных автомобилей вместе с Кастеллотти выиграл десятичасовую гонку в Мессине. В 1956 г. он с успехом продолжил выступать на спортивных автомобилях Ferrari, став победителем на Гран При Адагира, Дакара и Швеции. Правда, в гонках Формулы 1 все складывалось не так радужно – ему никак не удавалось показать хорошее время ни на Vanwall, ни на претенциозном, но совершенно неудачном Bugatti. В 1957 г. он стал реже появляться на трассе, правда, в гонке Ф2 Coupe de Vitesse в Реймсе за рулем Ferrari Dino V6 он финишировал победителем, а на Гран При Марокко в BRM P25 занял третье место.  
Морис вновь вышел на передний план в 1958 г., когда на маленьком Cooper Роба Уолкера одержал еще одну победу на Гран При Монако и стал победителем в По и Клермон-Ферране. Он провел в команде Уолкера два года и, несмотря на то, что ему приходилось быть вторым номером после Мосса, продемонстрировал прекрасные результаты в гонках Гран При в 1959 г. – в частности, снова праздновал триумф в По. В том же году Морис занял второе место в Ле-Мане за рулем Aston Martin, а в 1960 г. из-за множества проблем, с которыми ему пришлось столкнуться в команде Формулы 1 Дэвида Брауна, был вынужден провести несколько гонок за Centro Sud. В том же сезоне он несколько раз вышел на старт в Формуле 2 за рулем собственного Cooper, и множество результативных финишей принесли ему отличное вознаграждение. Он также был награжден орденом Почетного легиона за вклад в развитие французского автоспорта, но вовсе не собирался почивать на лаврах. После непростого 1961 года он в 1962 г. вернулся к Робу Уолкеру – причиной тому послужила авария в Гудвуде, положившая конец карьере Стирлинга Мосса. Несмотря на то, что лучшие его годы уже миновали, Тринтиньян по-прежнему мог кое-чему поучить Джима Кларка, что и продемонстрировал в По, одержав свою третью победу на этой трассе. 
В 1963 г. Морис практически перестал появляться на старте – казалось, он близок к тому, чтобы совсем уйти из гонок, но в 1964 г. он приобрел BRM V8 и весьма неплохо выступил на Гран При Германии, заняв пятое место и набрав, таким образом, два очка в зачете чемпионата мира – в возрасте 47 лет. Это был его последний сезон в мире Больших Призов, а свою прощальную гонку он провел в Ле-Мане в 1965 г., подведя черту под выдающейся карьерой, по ходу которой он – если не считать аварии в Бремгартене – считался одним из самых осторожных гонщиков. Он практически никогда не попадал ни в какие инциденты на трассе, а его талант «чувствовать» автомобиль, столько раз помогавший ему блестяще финишировать, высоко ценился менеджерами команд. 
В своей последней гонке «Какашка» выступал на Ford GT, замыкавшем собой длинный список автомобилей, за рулем которых ему довелось посидеть – а первым был, конечно же, Type 35 GP Bugatti – и причиной его схода в 24-часовой гонке стал уж никак не крысиный помет!";

Unfortunately this car was burnt out in practice for the 1962 Brussels GP, but Bernard reappeared in mid-1962 with another Cooper, achieving fifth place in the Mediterranean GP at Enna. 
Collomb then bought himself a Lotus 24-Climax V8 for 1963, but he was ill-equipped to drive it to its full potential. It was given occasional unsuccessful outings in 1964 before being destroyed by fire on the way back to France from the 1965 Syracuse GP, where he had finished seventh. A Lotus 35 F2 car was then purchased which again saw little action after Collomb crashed it in the 1966 Barcelona F2 race.

Then, at the Dutch GP, he had the first of two huge accidents in which he was seriously injured (the second at Albi in 1952 wrote off the Talbot). He reappeared in Claes Connaught at the Grand Prix at Spa in 1953, and then aligned himself with Gordini for 1954. He competed in only three Grands Prix, but raced in a good number of non-title races, his best results being second places at Chimay and Cadours.

He sprang to prominence in 1956 when he took his secondhand Mercedes 300SL to victory in the Liege-Rome-Liege Rally, beating the favourite, Olivier Gendebien, in the process, which sparked a bitter competition rivalry between the two Belgians. In 1957 Willy over-reached himself, wrecking a series of expensive cars, and he was lucky that Jacques Swaters rescued him from probable obscurity by furnishing him with a Ferrari Berlinetta for 1958 which he took to second place in the Reims 12 Hours. Mairesse clashed with Gendebien once more in the 1959 Tour de France, defeating his rival on a number of timed stages but missing out on overall victory. Ferrari took an interest in the little man, however, and offered him a drive in the 1960 Targa Florio. He finished fourth and was immediately taken into the works team for both F1 and sports cars. Late in the year he scored the first of two successive Tour de France victories in a Ferrari 250GT, but only after Gendebien of all people had helped to manhandle the Mairesse car from a ditch. 
This gutsy display from Willy made him Ferraris blue-eyed boy of the moment and he was retained in the sports car team for 1961, taking a number of GT victories and second place at Le Mans with Parkes. After buying a couple of GP rides at Spa and Reims, Mairesse blew another Ferrari F1 chance by crashing at the Nurburgring, but another win in the Tour de France may have kept him employed in 1962, Willy accepting the role of test driver vacated by Ginther, who had moved to BRM. 
The season started with wins in the Brussels and Naples GPs, before more success with victory in the Targa Florio. At the Belgian GP, though, Mairesse was involved in a lurid high-speed accident with Trevor Taylor, receiving burns which kept him out until a comeback at Monza which netted fourth place. He survived the Ferrari clear-out to partner Surtees in 1965, but his erratic performances culminated in a needless accident at the German GP when he wrote off the car and put himself out of racing for the remainder of the season. His Ferrari career finally at an end, Mairesse was still a more than useful sports car driver, and joined the Equipe Nationale Beige, winning the 1964 Angola GP in their Ferrari GTO and the Spa 500 Km in 1965. His last major win came the following year when he shared a Filipinetti Porsche Carrera with Herbert Muller to win the Targa Florio. His accident-prone career finally came to an end at the 1968 Le Mans 24 Hours when a door flew open on his Ford GT40, causing him to crash heavily, Mairesse suffering severe head injuries which left him unconscious for two weeks. He never fully recovered and after a year spent in poor health, and with no prospect of a return to racing, he committed suicide in an Ostend hotel room.";

As it was, Formula 1s loss was sports car racings gain, for he would then set about building and racing a succession of just about the most exciting sports cars ever seen. 
A multi-millionaire teenager after the death of his parents in an air crash, Hall soon became involved with racing and exotic cars, teaming up with Carroll Shelby to run a Texas Maserati dealership until he went into the oil business in 1958, continuing to race in SCCA events. 
Hall made an impressive GP debut at Riverside in 1960, lying fifth until last-lap gremlins intervened. This encouraged him to race a Lotus in 1961 and 62 - without success, although he finished fourth in the non-championship 1962 Mexican GP. His 1963 season with BRP was quite encouraging, Jim twice finishing in the points in GPs and taking fourth place in the Glover Trophy and sixth in the Lombank Trophy and at Solitude. 
With the Formula 1 bug out of his system, Hall set about completing the task he and Hap Sharp had first undertaken in 1962, namely building an advanced automatic-transmission sports car. Immersed in the Chaparrals innovative design, Jim continued to drive, regularly clocking up wins and placings, and in 1965 the car dominated USRRC sports car racing in North America. From 1966, he concentrated his driving activities on Can-Am, leaving the long-distance programme to Hill, Bonnier and Spence until rule changes forced his Chaparral 2F out. 
However, in the 1968 Stardust GP at Las Vegas, his Can-Am car ran into the back of a McLaren driven by Lothar Motschenbacher. The Chaparral flipped and was demolished, and Hall lay in hospital for nine weeks with multiple injuries. Apart from a couple of Trans-Am races in 1970, his racing career was over, but he continued to be involved with the sport throughout the seventies, collaborating with Carl Haas in F5000 before making a successful move to Indy Car racing with his own chassis. Hall pulled out at the end of the 1982 season and did not return until 1991. A fairy-tale first-time victory by John Andretti proved to be illusory, for the next three seasons saw the Pennzoil entry consistently underperforming. 
In 1995, bolstered by the talents of Rookie of the Year Gil de Ferran, the team were back in business, taking a win in the seasons finale at Laguna Seca. More success was anticipated in 1996 but, despite another win in Cleveland, Jim, after much thought decided the time was right for him to call it a day.

In the event Paul Emery departed before the season was out, and the two Americans formed the Scirocco-Powell team for 1963, using BRM power. The car was attractive but slow, Settember being flattered by an inherited second-place finish in the non-championship Austrian GP, some five laps down.

It was only when he began working for the Cooper team at their Surbiton factory that his career started to prosper. Although employed in part to help run the Coopers racing drivers school from Brands Hatch, Ian was cajoling the management into letting him race their new Formula 2 cars. 
Fourth place in the 1957 Gold Cup at Oulton Park led to a season in Tommy Atkins similar car for 1958. A brilliant start to the year saw Ian win at Crystal Palace and Snetterton and take fourth at both Montlhery and Reims, until a broken leg sustained in a crash at AVUS curtailed his season. 
He was back in 1959, driving for Atkins in F2 and also handling the Italian Scuderia Centro Sud teams Maserati-engined F1 Cooper, while a trip to New Zealand at the start of 1960 saw Ian win the Teretonga Trophy in Atkins Cooper. For 1961 Burgess became involved with the American Camoradi Team, racing their Lotus 18 with only moderate success at minor events. 
He concentrated on the plethora of non-championship races in 1962, driving a Cooper under the Anglo American Equipe banner. The seasons highlight was an excellent drive to fourth at Solitude. For the 1963 season, his last in racing, Burgess joined the Scirocco team, bankrolled by wealthy American businessman Hugh Powell, but it proved to be a dismal and costly exercise for all concerned.";

Invited by the Scuderia to join their Grand Prix line-up for the Italian GP, he sensationally put the car on the front row of the grid alongside the ill-fated championship favourite, von Trips. Not surprisingly he was signed by the team for a full season in 1962, but the car was far from the dominant machine of just a year earlier and young Ricardo, still a little wild and fearless, was used selectively. In a bright start, the Mexican took second place at the Pau GP, before confirming his outstanding potential in a number of World Championship rounds.

453;"Roy Salvadori";1;12.5.1922;"Доуверкот, Эссекс";;;;;"";"";"While not possessing the talent of his contemporaries Moss, Hawthorn, Collins and Brooks, Salvadori was a fine all-round driver, particularly in sports cars, who became a household name in Britain thanks to his many victories in races on home soil. Though born of Italian parentage, Salvadori was very much a Londoner at heart, and began racing for fun in 1946 before entering selected events the following year in an Alfa Romeo. Deciding to pursue a professional career, Roy sampled a variety of machines including a Healey, a Jaguar and a Frazer Nash on his way up the ladder. 
In 1952 he campaigned a four-cylinder Ferrari in the British GP and a few other minor races in addition to racing Tony Crooks Frazer Nash, but his sights were by now set on Grand Prix racing and he joined Connaught for the 1953 season. While he drew a blank in the World Championship races, there were plenty of successful outings in national events. He was happy to compete in almost any type of machine and often took part in three or more races during a single race meeting. 
Joining Syd Greene to race his potent Maserati 250F, Salvadori again concentrated on events at home during 1954-56, but by this time he was already a regular member of the Aston Martin sports car team, a role he was to fulfill right to the end of their programme, which finished on such a high note in 1959 when Roy shared the winning DBR1 at Le Mans with Carroll Shelby. 
For 1957 Roy aligned himself with Cooper as they developed their rear-engined Formula 2 car in preparation for a full season of Grands Prix the following year. Fifth place in the British GP at Aintree put him among the championship points scorers for the first time, and in non-title races he took a second at Caen and a fourth at Reims. The 1958 season saw the Surbiton teams first sustained effort at the top level, and Brabham and Salvadori both scored some excellent results. Roys second place to Brooks in the German GP may have been distant but it was a portent of even greater things to follow, but Roy was sadly not to be part of the great works Cooper triumph. 
In 1959 Salvadori continued to drive Coopers in Formula 2, but for Tommy Atkins, his best result being a win in the London Trophy at Crystal Palace. Meanwhile Aston Martin had ambitiously decided to embark on a Grand Prix programme of their own and Roy was to be one of the drivers, but crucially they had opted to adopt the traditional front-engined layout which, of course, was soon doomed to oblivion. Their cars were superbly crafted and beautifully turned out, but after Salvadori had scored a totally misleading second place in the International Trophy early in 1959, they proved to be a major disappointment. The engine just didnt possess enough power and, despite major reworkings, the project was a hopeless failure which drifted on into 1960, by which time the writing was well and truly on the wall. 
The following season Roy joined John Surtees in Reg Parnells well-funded Yeoman Credit-backed team racing Coopers. However, the Surbiton-built cars had had their day, as Colin Chapman had devoured every lesson they had to offer and combined them with his own thinking to push his Lotus 18 and 21 models to the fore. Salvadori was as close as he ever would be to winning a Grand Prix at Watkins Glen that year when he was closing in on Innes Irelands leading Lotus before the engine failed. The team had high hopes for 1962 with the new Lola chassis, but it was to be a desperately disappointing season for Salvadori, who was totally overshadowed by Surtees, almost being reduced to the role of hack driver. Wisely perhaps, he decided that Grand Prix success was now beyond his reach, and he returned to sports and touring car racing with Tommy Atkins Cooper Monaco, Shelby Cobra and Jaguar E-Type cars. Although his front-line career was behind him, there was no easing up in his driving style, for Roy had never taken any prisoners and he wasnt going to change his approach in the twilight of his career! 
By the time he retired early in 1965 Salvadori had driven on most of the worlds circuits. He knew the risks attendant on them, for he had seen many of his peers perish over his long career, and indeed had come perilously close to joining them on more than one occasion. He also knew his own worth and the thought of racing without starting money was anathema to him. After his driving days were over, he became the team manager at Cooper in 1966-67, before retiring to Monaco in the late sixties, where he resides to this day. His apartment overlooking the Monte Carlo circuit still attracts many old friends from his racing days for a wonderful view of the Grand Prix each May.";

469;"Stirling Moss";1;17.9.1929;"Уэст-Кенсингтон, Лондон";;;;;"";"";"The long career and many brilliant deeds of Stirling Moss far outstrip the space available to describe them here, and his successes are also far too numerous to list. Thus a broad brush must be used to give an impression of this patriotic and ultra-professional driver, who had a clear idea of his own worth. Without vanity, he quite soundly reasoned that the World Championship which the British public were so desperate for him to win was utterly meaningless as a measure of a drivers abilities. Painstaking and thorough in his approach, in his prime Stirlings mastery of the skills of his profession was absolute. Capable of driving just about any machine with equal excellence, Moss never gave less than 100 per cent and, no matter what the situation, he simply never gave up. 
His career began in 1947 with a BMW 328, but he was soon scrapping it out in the rough and tumble of 500 cc racing with a Cooper-JAP. In 1950 he scored his first major success, winning the Tourist Trophy in a Jaguar XK120, and during the next three seasons he drove a variety of cars - HWM, Formula 3 Kieft, Frazer-Nash and Jaguar - sampling success in all of them. Only the ERA C-Type was a complete failure, and by 1953 Stirlings talents were coveted by Ferrari. Actually Moss had his eyes fixed on a seat with Mercedes-Benz, but Neubauer was not yet convinced that the youngster was ready. So for the 1954 season Moss bought a Maserati 250F and promptly took third place at Spa. Later in the year, he accepted the offer of a works car, and duly led the Mercedes of Fangio at Monza until the oil tank split. He was then signed by Mercedes for the 1955 season alongside the Maestro. In Grands Prix he watched and learned much from his august partner, scoring a famous victory in the British GP in the July sunshine at Aintree, and he also won the Mille Miglia and the Targa Florio in the silver sports cars. Unfortunately the Le Mans disaster prompted Mercedes withdrawal from the sport, and Stirling joined Maserati as number one driver in 1956. Despite wins at Monaco and Monza, retirements elsewhere cost him dear and the championship went to Fangio and Ferrari. It was a very productive year overall, however, with no fewer than 16 race wins in the 250F, the Maserati 300TS and the Vanwall among others. 
His patriotism was at last rewarded when Vanwall offered him a machine worthy of his talents in 1957, and in the British GP Moss fulfilled a long-held ambition by giving a green car victory in a World Championship Grand Prix after taking over Brooks sister entry. There were further wins at Pescara and Monza, and hopes were high for the championship in 1958. He started the season with a quite brilliant win in Rob Walkers little Cooper before resuming the fight in Vandervells machines. Once again the unreliability of the car torpedoed Mosss personal title chances but, with Brooks and Lewis-Evans backing him up, the team took the constructors title before withdrawing from Grand Prix racing at the seasons end. 
By now Moss had ceased to worry unduly about the championship. Certainly Ferrari would have given anything to sign him, but he preferred the comfortable ambience of Walkers little team, with Rob himself offering discreet guidance and Alf Francis fettling the cars. Stirling possibly hindered his chances by switching about a bit too often, surmising that the BRP BRM would be better suited to Reims and Aintree, but he won in Portugal and Italy in the Walker Cooper. In 1960 Stirling had the choice of a Cooper and the new Lotus 18, which he used to win the Monaco GP, but in practice for the Belgian GP his Lotus shed a wheel, leaving him suffering from serious back injuries. Characteristically, he set himself impossible targets for his comeback and returned in time to take another win at the end of the year at Riverside. 
In 1961 we saw the true genius of Moss at Monaco and particularly the Nurburgring, where he defeated the shark-nose Ferrari 156 V6 cars of Phil Hill and Taffy von Trips. These victories were inevitably just outcrops of a seam of success that ran through the season, into the winter months at Nassau, and then across the world early in 1962 in Australia and New Zealand. On his return to Britain, Moss drove the pale-green UDT-entered Lotus to seventh in the Lombank Trophy before heading down to Goodwood for the Easter Monday meeting. Why he crashed is still not clear, but his car was wrecked and Stirling was hospitalised with serious head injuries. His recuperation was to be a slow one this time. Almost a year later he tried a car in a private test but his fears were realised. The sharp edge of his reflexes had gone, and wisely he decided he would not race again, thus leaving intact memories of a driver who always competent the peak of his powers. Stirling then launched himself into myriad business ventures, many of which kept him in touch with the sport. In the late seventies he was tempted back to the track, mainly for fun, in historic cars and saloons. 
With the new millennium approaching, Stirling, who had just celebrated his seventieth birthday, was given a knighthood in the 2000 New Years Honours. It was a fitting confirmation of the high esteem in which this truly great driver is held.";

However, when the flag dropped Trips was not the quickest away and was enmeshed in the leading bunch which hammered around the banking to complete the first lap. The German was under pressure from the Lotus of Jim Clark and when the young Scot pulled out of the Ferrari's slipstream in an attempt to pass, Trips moved over too...

The driver lay on the circuit, flung like a rag doll; Jim Clark was wandering around unhurt but in shock as the cars sped past on their third lap; and one driver and 14 spectators were to pay the sport's ultimate price. The race went on, and team-mate Phil Hill was crowned World Champion, but Wolfgang von Trips was dead. Such were the stark realities of motor racing.
The German had always lived on the edge. His first Grand Prix appearance at Monza was ended by a practice crash when the steering failed, but he escaped serious injury this time around. In 1958 he collided with Schell on the opening lap and ended up with a broken leg. Returning to action at the start of 1959 he spun the works F2 Porsche at Monaco and eliminated the rest of his class. This sorry tally makes him seem a liability, but that was far from the case, for from the earliest days, when he took a third place in the 1955 Tourist Trophy in a Mercedes 300SLR at Dundrod, Trips was a fearless and skilled driver, particularly in sports cars. He was European hill-climb champion in 1958 in a works Porsche RSK, and in 1959 drove a brilliant race in the small-capacity Porsche in the Tourist Trophy at Goodwood to finish second ahead of Brooks' Ferrari.
By 1960 von Trips was emerging as a trusty and reliable single-seater exponent. Apart from his placings in the championship races, he won at Syracuse and Solitude for Ferrari, and took second in the F2 German GP for Porsche. His work with the rear-engined prototype car set him up for the 1961 season, and with the new 156 'sharknose' Ferrari he took his first Grand Prix win at Zandvoort in masterly style. In sports cars, the Targa Florio was won with Gendebien, and then back in F1 he coped with the early wet conditions at Aintree to extend his championship lead. Even a second place behind the genius of Moss in the German Grand Prix seemed to be sufficient, for the next race was at Monza and, surely, the title would be his…";

That year he also began racing the works Lotus Eleven sports cars for Colin Chapman, culminating in an Index of Performance win with the little 750 cc Lotus at Le Mans in 1957 - a season which also saw the Hornsey team move into single-seaters with their Lotus 12. 
Ambitious plans were made for 1958 and Cliff led the team in their World Championship assault. He scored a fine fourth at Spa, finishing behind three cars which it transpired would not have survived a further lap, and put up a tremendous performance in the German Grand Prix when a burst radiator cost him a possible sensational win in the Lotus 16. His efforts did not go unnoticed, though, and on the recommendation of Mike Hawthorn Cliff was invited by Ferrari for tests at Modena and offered a works drive for 1959. 
After a solid first season at Maranello his fortunes were to be mixed; 1960 began with success in Argentina, Cliff winning the 1000 Km for sports cars with Phil Hill and taking second place in the Grand Prix, but a practice crash at Monaco in which he was flung from the car and badly broke his arm curtailed his season. When fully recovered, he signed for the UDT Laystall team to race their Lotus 18 in 1961 and played himself back to form in the many non-championship races held that year, his results including a second place in the International Trophy, run to the 2.5 litre Inter-Continental Formula. For the Belgian Grand Prix, Cliff had to set a quicker practice time than team-mate Henry Taylor in order to claim the car for the race. Disaster struck when he crashed heavily and was thrown from the Lotus, sustaining serious leg injuries which prompted his retirement from racing.";

Although naturally somewhat overshadowed by his more experienced peers, he scored good championship finishes at Bremgarten and Monza, and took third behind Kling and Fangio in what amounted to a Mercedes demonstration race against meagre opposition at AVUS. He still drove for Porsche in sports cars, and won the support race at AVUS and another at the Nurburgring. Better still he took sixth in the Mille Miglia, again taking the up-to-1500 cc class, before venturing across to Mexico to compete in the Carrera Panamericana. In another superb drive, Hans took his Porsche 550 Spyder to third overall and naturally won his class. 
Prospects were promising indeed for the young German in 1955, but after sharing fourth place with Moss and Kling in the searing heat of Argentina, a practice accident for the next Grand Prix at Monte Carlo left him in hospital with cracked vertebrae and broken ribs. 
With Mercedes withdrawal from racing after the Le Mans tragedy, Herrmann, now fully recovered, joined Porsche for 1956 and with von Trips he took sixth (and a class win) at Sebring. Sharing a Ferrari with Gendebien he was third in the Targa Florio that year, but would then become a mainstay of the Porsche team. He was third at Le Mans with Behra in 1958 and fourth in the Nurburgring 1000 Km the following year with Maglioli. Sadly his subsequent Grand Prix appearances were generally restricted to less-than-competitive machinery, and he caused a stir only with his spectacular crash in the 1959 German GP at AVUS, when he was thrown from his BRM, fortunately without serious injury. 
Hans enjoyed some excellent drives in Formula 2 for Porsche in 1960, taking second at Solitude, fourth at Modena and fifth in the non-championship German Grand Prix, but found real success throughout the decade in sports cars, winning the Sebring 12 Hours (1960 and 1968), the Daytona 24 Hours (1968), the Targa Florio (1960) and the Paris 1000 Km (1968). He was of course involved in the incredible finish at Le Mans in 1969 when his Porsche was pipped by Jacky Ickxs Ford, but he made amends a year later to bow out on a high note, retiring from racing after winning the Sarthe classic in a Porsche 917 with Richard Attwood.";
473;"Tony Brooks";1;25.2.1932;"Дакинфилд, Чешир";;;;;"";"";"Tony Brooks was still a dental student with little front-line experience when he shot to international prominence on the back of an absolutely stunning win at the Syracuse GP in the works Connaught in 1955. In only his second-ever race abroad, the slightly built and reserved youngster trounced the works Maserati and Gordini cars, three times breaking the lap record, and setting a best race lap some five seconds faster than his qualifying time. It had all seemed so easy, yet this was the first Continental win by a British car and driver since Henry Segrave won at San Sebastian in 1924, so the excitement it generated was naturally immense. Few guessed that the floodgates were soon to be opened, and that for British teams and drivers this was just the start. 
After racing a Healey in 1952, Tony switched to a Frazer Nash, competing mainly in club events during the next two seasons - successfully, but largely unnoticed. It was the middle of the 1955 season that really saw Brooks career take a step forward. Having raced Aston Martins DB3S at Le Mans and Goodwood (where he shared third place with Peter Collins), he drove Riseley-Prichards F2 Connaught in the Daily Telegraph Trophy at Aintree, finishing fourth behind the Formula 1 cars of Hawthorn, Schell and Salvadori. A win in the F2 class of the Avon Trophy at Castle Combe immediately preceded his momentous Syracuse victory, which of course made Brooks a very hot property indeed. 
Signed by BRM for the 1956 season, he took second place in the Aintree 200 after being hampered by brake trouble, and then - the team having withdrawn after practice at Monaco - he prepared for his first championship Grand Prix start at Silverstone. It was nearly his last; when the throttle stuck at Abbey Curve, the car somersaulted, throwing out the driver, who was lucky to escape with a fractured jaw. 
Joining Vanwall for 1957, Brooks soon displayed the smooth style and masterful car control that was to bring him so much success in the next three seasons. After finishing second to Fangio, no less, at Monaco, his season was hampered by the effects of a crash at Le Mans, which accounted for his handing his car to Moss at Aintree, where the British pair shared a momentous victory in their home Grand Prix. The following season saw Vanwall and Ferrari wage a ferocious battle for supremacy, and although Hawthorn took the drivers championship Moss, Brooks and Lewis-Evans ensured the constructors title came to Britain. Tonys three victories at the classic circuits of Spa, the Nurburgring and Monza spoke for themselves. Here was a driver of true championship pedigree. 
Unfortunately Tony Vandervell withdrew from racing at the end of the year, and Brooks joined Ferrari to drive their front-engined 246 Dino. He again put in some superb performances, finishing second at Monaco despite physical sickness due to cockpit fumes, and giving wonderful demonstrations of high-speed artistry at Reims and AVUS. Ferrari did not enter his cars at Aintree, so Vandervell brought out one of his Vanwalls especially for Brooks, but he retired with ignition trouble. If it were not for a clutch failure at the start of the Italian GP, Tony may have been able to take the championship from Brabhams fleet little Cooper, but it was not to be. 
With increasing business interests and recently married to an Italian girl, Pina, Tony stayed in England during 1960 and, after a Vanwall previously promised by Vandervell failed to materialise, took in a limited programme of events in the Yeoman Credit Cooper. The 1959 Type 51 car was certainly not particularly competitive, especially when Colin Chapmans Lotus 18 and then Coopers works T53 lowline designs appeared and swamped the opposition. Nevertheless Tony continued to give of his best, driving harder than ever in a fruitless attempt to make up for the cars lack of performance. 
In 1961 he joined BRM alongside Graham Hill and once again endured the frustration of having to campaign with an underpowered four-cylinder Climax engine against the might of Ferrari and their V6 sharknose cars. There were still glimpses of the Brooks of old (at Aintree, where he set the fastest lap in the rain, and a superb drive into third place in the US GP), after which he quietly retired to successfully develop his Weybridge garage business. 
Having recently retired from the day-to-day running of this concern, Tony now has more time to give to the sport and he has been a welcome and popular celebrity guest at some of the many popular historic car events around the world.";

475;"Henry Taylor";1;16.12.1932;"Шеффорд, Бедфордшир";;;;;"";"";"A farmer, Taylor entered club racing in 1954 with a Cooper-Vincent, taking the Autosport championship the following year. He added to his experience racing a Jaguar D-Type, taking third in the 1957 Belgian sports car GP, but it was 1958 before he began to make his mark in single-seaters, winning the GP de Paris in a Cooper. He continued to make good progress in Formula 2, taking a superb second place at the 1959 Auvergne Trophy, ahead of McLarens works car, and second in class at the British GP at Aintree. 
For 1960 Taylor signed to race Ken Tyrrells Cooper-Austin in Formula Junior, winning the prestigious Monaco race, and made his debut in the Yeoman Credit Cooper, scoring a morale-boosting fourth place at Reims for a team still reeling from Bristows fatal accident at Spa. He continued under the UDT Laystall banner in 1961, racing the teams Lotus 18/21 F1 car as well as a Lotus 19 in sports car events. Taylor gained a few minor placings outside Grands Prix, until a nasty crash in the British GP left him injured and trapped in his car. He recovered to compete again at the ill-fated Monza race when, perhaps with the tragic events of the day in mind, he decided to retire from circuit racing to concentrate on farming. 
Taylor was soon back in action, rallying for Ford, and became the first man to compete in the Cortina. He later returned to the tracks occasionally in 1963 and 1964, when he finished second at both Zolder and Brands Hatch and third at the Nurburgring in Alan Manns Lotus-Cortina. After finally retiring in 1966, he became competitions manager at Ford.";

Gendebien then returned and raced a Veritas in the GP des Frontieres at Chimay, finishing sixth, before joining Fraikin, initially to rally a Jaguar, the pair staying together until 1955. By the time they split they had become known as the eternal bridesmaids due to the number of times they had to be content with second place. Twice they just missed winning the Liege-Rome-Liege Rally but in 1955 it was third time lucky with a Mercedes 300SL Without his partner, Olivier had great success, winning his class with a Plymouth in the Round Italy Rally, the Tulip Rally and the Northern Roads Rally in a Porsche, all in 1954. 
Such was the impression made that he was offered a contract to drive a works Ferrari in sports car events and selected Grands Prix. His first race for the team nearly ended in disaster, when in late 1955 he crashed heavily in practice for the Tourist Trophy at Dundrod, suffering concussion. He was fit for the start of 1956 and, with virtually no single-seater experience behind him, finished fifth on his Grand Prix debut at the Argentine GP, followed by sixth in the Mendoza GP. The season also saw a splendid run of finishes in sports car races, including second places at Buenos Aires and in the Supercortemaggiore at Monza and thirds in the Nurburgring 1000 Km, Targa Florio and Le Mans. 
That was to be the first of seven wonderful seasons that Gendebien spent in Ferraris sports car team. He subsequently won the Reims 12 Hours in 1957 and 58, the Targa Florio in 1958, 61 and 62, Sebring in 1959, 60 and 61 and the Nurburgring 1000 Km in 1962, not forgetting his splendid achievement of four wins at Le Mans in 1958, 60, 61 and 62, after the last of which he retired. 
He was no slouch in a Grand Prix car either. His outings were generally infrequent, but whenever he raced a competitive machine he invariably brought it into the points, as a check on the statistics overleaf will show. But it is inevitably as one of the greatest sports car drivers of any era that he will be best remembered.";

In 1957 he bought a Formula 2 Cooper, which he used to dominate Libre events at home and also raced on the Continent, making his debut in the German GP, where he took fourth in the F2 class. Over the next three seasons Marsh sensibly raced the Cooper in events where success was a realistic proposition, his best result being a win in the 1960 Lewis-Evans Trophy at Brands Hatch. 
For 1961 Tony obtained a Lotus 18, which he drove in Grands Prix and even hill-climbs, winning five of the six events he entered, but despite a third on aggregate in the Brussels GP he soon set it aside in favour of a BRM. Then in 1962 a planned season with a works-tended BRM ended in legal action as Marsh felt the machine was unraceworthy. From then on he concentrated fully on the hill-climb scene, eventually replacing the BRM with a fearsome 4.3-litre Marsh-Oldsmobile special, with which he took another three titles to add to those won back in the fifties.";

At this time he bought a Ferrari 500 to race in Formula 1, but after a fourth place in the 1956 Naples GP he proved to be hopelessly slow in his efforts to qualify at Monaco. 
For 1957, Giorgio aligned himself with the works Maserati team and shared a point with Schell for their fifth place in the Italian GP, taking another fifth at the Modena GP and sixth at the Pescara GP, although he was ten minutes behind the winner. 
After the works team had closed their doors, Scarlatti soldiered on with the 250F, sharing fourth place in the Buenos Aires City GP after Behra took over the car, and earned third place (and a class win) in the Targa Florio when he partnered Behra in the Frenchmans Porsche. 
In 1959, Giorgio again raced the outdated Maserati, but disappointed when entrusted with the third works Cooper at Monza in place of the injured Masten Gregory.

These remained his staple diet until the war intervened, during which he saw service in the Tank Corps. 
Jacks career moved onto a wider stage in the late forties as he raced at Le Mans and Spa for the first time. Strong as an ox, and an extremely safe and reliable driver, Fairman was ideally suited to long-distance sports car racing, in which he raced with distinction for Bristol, Jaguar, Ecurie Ecosse and Aston Martin during the fifties. His greatest successes came in 1959 when, driving the Aston, he won the Nurburgring 1000 Km (with Moss at his brilliant best) and the Tourist Trophy at Goodwood (with Moss and Shelby). 
With his engineering background Fairman was also in great demand as a test driver and was instrumental in the development of the Connaught GP car, being rewarded with points finishes in each of his two Grand Prix appearances in 1956. 
Jack seemed to thrive on picking up irregular rides here and there and raced a bewildering succession of machines in different categories (including on occasion works cars from Cooper and BRM and the Rob Walker 4WD Ferguson) during an extremely long career which lasted into the early sixties.

Детство, пришедшееся на тридцатые годы, прошло в атмосфере гонок – его отец Лори был главой Ecurie Bleue, команды, выводившей на трассу автомобили Delahaye и Talbot. После гибели мужа в дорожной катастрофе мать Харри, Люси, приняла на себя управление командой и вывела Рене Дрейфуса на старт в Индианаполисе перед самой войной. Юный Харри поехал вместе с ней и принял решение непременно выступить в гонках самому – как только достигнет подходящего возраста. 
 Во время войны он служил в войсках США в Финляндии, а к концу сороковых годов начал предпринимать свои первые шаги в автогонках. В 1949 г. он умудрился занять второе место в Coupe de Salon в Монлери за рулем Talbot, но только годом спустя, выступая на Cooper-JAP, он добился серьезных успехов. Он управлял маленьким автомобильчиком с невероятной энергией, частенько приводя соперников по Формуле 2 в замешательство. На Circuit du Lac, в Экс-ле-Бэн, он с успехом обошел заводские Ferrari и лидировал в гонке, пока не вынужден был сойти. В том же году ему выпала возможность принять участие в Гран При Монако, однако уже на первом круге он выбыл из борьбы из-за массовой аварии; зато в Бремгартене ему наконец-то удалось выступить на «настоящей» машине Гран При, и он привел Talbot на восьмое место.  
В 1951 и 1952 гг. Шелл выступал преимущественно за Ecurie Plate на Maserati, но солидных результатов стал добиваться только после перехода в Simca Gordini. Второе место на Гран При Кадура вдохновило и команду, и гонщика на продолжение сотрудничества и в следующем сезоне; в чемпионате мира Харри не слишком везло, зато он смог неплохо финишировать в ряде гонок французского первенства. В 1954 г. Шелл выступал на собственной Maserati A6GCM, в Кастельфузано был вторым, в Пескаре и Эйнтри – третьим, на старт Гран При Испании в конце сезона он вышел за рулем Maserati 250F и вызвал целый переполох – в самом начале гонки он резко оторвался от преследователей и уступил лидерство Фанхио только после разворота, но в конце концов сошел из-за отказа коробки передач. Все говорили об американце, выступающем с полупустыми баками, чтобы опередить соперников, но он и в самом деле сделал себе имя - его услугами пользовались и Vanwall, и Ferrari, а для Тони Вандервелла он выиграл несколько второстепенных соревнований. В 1956 г. Шелл продемонстрировал удивительные возможности зеленых автомобилей, устроив потрясающее шоу в Реймсе, когда он буквально наступал на пятки заводским Ferrari, одержал победу на Гран При Каена, после чего в 1957 г. перешел в заводскую команду Maserati.  
Харри добросовестно исполнял роль второй скрипки при Фанхио, демонстрируя неплохие результаты, в числе которых было и третье место в Пескаре. В По он финишировал вторым, в Модене – третьим, а затем заключил контракт с BRM на сезоны 1958 и 1959 гг. Харри оказался прекрасным приобретением для команды – в Зандфорте он занял второе место, и это был единственный раз, когда американец так близко подобрался к оставшемуся недостижимым Большому Призу. В конце 1959 г. он приобрел Cooper-Climax, на котором выступал как частник под наименованием Ecurie Bleue. Он продолжил выступления и в начале 1960 г., после чего присоединился к команде Yeoman Credit. За рулем одного из их автомобилей он и погиб во время тренировки перед International Trophy – потерял управление своим Cooper на одном из скоростных отрезков влажной трассы в Силверстоуне. Харри был очень популярен, и его смерть стала большой потерей для всего автоспортивного мира.";

He won seven races with his own car in 1956, before gaining an invitation to drive for the works during the following season. 
Alan had the handicap of an artificial lower right leg, but this proved no obstacle to his racing, nor did it seem to limit his competitiveness, otherwise Colin Chapman would certainly not have signed him to race his sports cars full-time for 1958. He won the Farningham Trophy at Brands Hatch, and scored another victory at Crystal Palace, also taking third place in the Rouen GP. Stacey made his Grand Prix debut at Silverstone that year but, in common with his team-mates Innes Ireland and Graham Hill, he was to suffer a frustrating 1959 season as a lack of reliability undermined the Lotus teams efforts in F1, F2 and sports car racing. 
With Hill departing for BRM, Alan was promoted to the position of Irelands number two in 1960, and once the European season started he had one of Chapmans stunning rear-engined Lotus 18s to drive. He finished fourth in the International Trophy race, but retired at both Monaco and Zandvoort, where he lay in third place before transmission trouble. However, during the Belgian GP at Spa, it is thought the luckless Stacey was hit full in the face by a bird, the stunned driver losing control and suffering fatal injuries after being flung from the car when it hit a bank.";

Certainly he was very, very quick but sadly we would never find out just how much he could have achieved. 
With the support of his father, Chris entered racing in 1956 at the wheel of an MG Special with which he scored an early win at Crystal Palace. Realising that he needed more competitive machinery than the special, he acquired an 1100 cc Cooper sports car for 1957 and won more than a dozen minor scratch and handicap events with it in a highly satisfying year. 
For 1958 the Cooper was no longer eligible, so he purchased a very fast - but not so reliable - Elva, with which he traded places regularly with the more fashionable Lotus. His efforts brought him to the attention of the British Racing Partnership, who invited him to join them for 1959 to race their Formula 2 Cooper-Borgwards and Cooper-Monaco sports cars. 
It was the John Davy Trophy at Brands Hatch that really brought him to the attention of the public, Bristow taking an aggregate win from Brabham, Salvadori and McLaren with an impressive display of speed coupled with a maturity that belied his inexperience. 
For 1960 BRP - under the Yeoman Credit Racing Team banner -pinned their hopes on young Bristow and the experienced Harry Schell. When Schell was killed in practice for the International Trophy, Chris, something of loner, found himself paired with Tony Brooks. It would have been fascinating to measure his stature against a proven world-class pilot, but in the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa, while dicing with the Ferrari of the equally combative Willy Mairesse, he lost control of his Cooper, slid into some trackside fencing and was killed instantly in a gruesome accident.";

By then, however, the car was showing its age and he turned to a Lister-Jaguar and a year of national sports car racing - which must certainly have sharpened up his driving, for he was a much improved performer when he returned to single-seaters in 1959 with a new Lotus 16, though his best result was a third in the Silver City Trophy race at Snetterton, guesting for the BRM team. 
In 1960 Halford handled a Cooper with only moderate success, thereafter scaling down his racing activities. 
With the new-found popularity of historic racing in the late seventies, Bruce returned to the circuits at the wheel of an immaculate Lotus 16 and enjoyed himself immensely in the friendly but fiercely competitive atmosphere.";

This proved to be very successful, with Daigh winning the Governors Cup (beating Hansgens Lister) and the Nassau Trophy, and defeating Phil Hills Ferrari at Riverside. 
Ambitiously, a front-engined F1 car was then commissioned by Reventlow, but by the time it appeared in 1960 it had been rendered almost obsolete by the rear-engined Cooper and Lotus cars. Chuck struggled manfully against the odds but the car was withdrawn after just three races, reappearing only on home soil at seasons end. Daigh meanwhile had the chance to try a proper F1 car at the British GP when he drove a third works Cooper. Amazingly the Scarab raced again, being wheeled out for the Inter-Continental Formula in 1961. Chuck finished seventh in the International Trophy race, but after he crashed in practice for the British Empire Trophy - suffering a cracked pelvis - the car was seen no more. 
Fortunately Daigh was seen again, racing one of Jim Halls early Chaparrals at Sebring in 1962, and tasted victory at Mosport in 1963 when he won the Players 200 sports car race in a Lotus 19.";

The following year he came to Europe to buy a Maserati sports car, which he crashed badly at Snetterton, escaping unharmed. He also raced an F2 Cooper briefly, before returning home. 
Reventlow then decided to build his own sports car, the Scarab, for 1958. It was a success and, with Chuck Daigh, Lance ambitiously planned a front-engined Grand Prix car which the pair would drive, but when it finally appeared in 1960 the outdated design was hopelessly outclassed. So frustrated were the drivers that, by the British GP, the car had been temporarily abandoned in favour of a third works Cooper. Both Lance and Daigh practised in it, but Chuck, being the faster, drove it in the race. The Scarab project struggled on in the hope of some success in the 1961 Inter-Continental Formula, but when that folded, so did the team. 
Reventlow returned to the States to race a new Scarab rear-engined sports car briefly before losing interest in the sport completely. He was killed in 1972, when he was a passenger in a light aeroplane which crashed in bad weather over the Rocky Mountains.";

Naturally this brought him to the attention of BRM, who signed him up in 1954, initially to race in national Formula Libre events with the supercharged car. He also made his GP debut that season, taking over Biras Maserati in the British GP before crashing. 
In 1956 Ron was invited to race in sports cars for Ecurie Ecosse and won at Le Mans (with Sanderson) with their Jaguar E-Type, while he took full advantage of a last-minute opportunity to race for Connaught, finishing third in the Italian GP. The 1957 season saw him repeat his Le Mans success for Ecosse (this time with Bueb), but his luck with BRM was still out, an accident in the French GP leaving him with burns to arm and legs. The following year was marred by further injury after a crash at Rouen in a sports car race, but he was back in action for 1959 and won the Lady Wigram Trophy in New Zealand and the minor Silver City Trophy at Snetterton for BRM. Easily his best effort that year was to finish sixth in the French GP when a stone smashed his goggles and he drove on gamely to the finish with the use of virtually only one eye and a badly cut face.

Even today those old enough to recall Behra remember the tiger, and those like me, too young to have seen him, are inspired by his mighty reputation and heroic deeds when, in the early fifties, he was cast as the perpetual underdog, battling for Gordini against the mighty works teams. 
Behra took up the four-wheeled discipline after an immensely successful motor cycling career in which he was French champion three years running. Switching from his red bike to the French blue of Talbot, he placed sixth in the 1949 Coupe du Salon at Montlhery, and then took part in the 1950 Monte Carlo Rally driving a Simca with Roger Lover, another ex-motor cyclist who was later to race Gordinis. A month later Jean won a hill-climb in a borrowed Maserati four-cylinder, bringing him to the attention of Amedee Gordini. A drive in the 1950 Bol dOr at St Germain convinced le patron that here was a nugget that could be polished, and Behra was signed for the 1951 season, beginning his serious motor racing career at the age of 30. He finished third in his first race at Les Sables dOlonne, and then did the same at Cadours. 
It was 1952, however, when Behra became a national hero for his deeds not in championship Grands Prix, though he did superbly well to finish third at Bremgarten and fifth at the Nurburgring - circuits for the skilled and brave - but at the non-championship Reims GP. With Ascari hitherto virtually unbeatable, there was some surprise when Behra shot into an early lead, and this became mild consternation as the light-blue car held off the Ferrari challenge for lap after lap. Then came frenzied hysteria as the T500 suffered an engine failure, leaving Jean to cruise to a historic victory, much to the delight of the delirious French public. There were post-race mutterings about an oversize engine, but the result stood and Behra was for ever taken to the hearts of his countrymen. 
He stayed with Gordini to the end of the 1954 season, suffering the heartbreaking succession of maladies that inevitably struck at the little underfinanced equipe, but when results were achieved the success was all the sweeter, as at Pau in 1954 when, after more than three hours racing, Behra defeated the works Ferrari of Trintignant by a mere 60 yards. 
After a test in a Maserati at Monza, where Ascari no less could only equal his time, Behra signed for the 1955 season and was immediately rewarded with non-championship wins at Pau and Bordeaux. Although he was out of luck in championship Grands Prix, Behra took sports car wins at Bari, Monza, the Nurburgring and Oporto in the 300TS, before a crash in the Tourist Trophy resulted in his ear being sliced off - Jean subsequently receiving a plastic replacement. For 1956 he was relegated to the number two slot with the arrival of Stirling Moss, but this did not dampen his spirit; he merely raised his game to enjoy his best-ever championship year, even if that much sought first Grand Prix win still eluded him. 
In 1957 he was cast as number two to Fangio, but still had his moments, none more memorable than the British GP when he left them all - Fangio, Hawthorn, Moss and Collins - in his wake until his Maseratis clutch failed. Perversely in non-title events his luck would hold, and he won the Pau, Modena and Moroccan GPs for Maserati, and the Caen GP and the International Trophy for BRM. 
The following season, driving for BRM in F1 and for Porsche in sports cars and Formula 2, Behra had little luck with the cars from Bourne but won sports car races at AVUS and Rouen and took the Formula 2 honours at AVUS and in the Coupe de Vitesse at Reims. An offer to drive for a Ferrari team now bereft of Hawthorn, Collins and Musso in 1959 was too good to turn down, and the signs were encouraging when he won the Aintree 200 and finished second in the Syracuse GP after a spirited battle with Moss ended in a spin. Two sports car races for the Scuderia yielded a second place at Sebring with Allison and a third in the Nurburgring 1000 Km with Brooks, while he finished second in the Auvergne Trophy at Clermont Ferrand in his own Porsche. In championship Grands Prix, a great drive at Reims ended with engine failure. On pulling his stricken Ferrari into the pits, the frustration was too much for the little Frenchman, who was involved in a scuffle with team manager Tavoni which ended with Behra being shown the door. Running his own Porsches, he was entered for both the Grand Prix and the sports car race at AVUS, but in the rain-soaked support race he was killed instantly when he lost control on the slippery banking, crashed and was flung out of the car into a flag pole.";

The high point of his season, though, was his win at Le Mans with Hawthorn in the D-Type Jaguar. 
Bueb cheerfully continued to race anything and everything that came his way in the next few seasons, winning the Reims 12 Hours for Jaguar (with Hamilton) in 1956 and repeating his Le Mans triumph with Hawthorn in 1957, a year which saw his Formula 1 debut for Connaught, Bueb claiming fifth at Syracuse and third at Pau in the ageing car. 
Although opportunities at Grand Prix level were limited, Ivor maintained his busy racing schedule in 1958, campaigning his own Lotus 12 in F2 and driving for Ecurie Ecosse and Lister in sports cars.

He soon progressed to more potent machinery with an Allard-Cadillac and a Ferrari in 1953, and the following season he competed abroad for the first time, racing in Argentina before coming over to Europe to drive David Browns Aston Martin DB3S. 
In 1955 Shelby continued to race in sports car events, sharing a Ferrari with Phil Hill to take second place in the Sebring 12 Hours, and also made his F1 debut for Maserati with a sixth place in the Syracuse GP. Staying in the US for 1956, Carroll virtually swept the board in SCCA circles, winning 27 races -19 of them consecutively - in his Ferrari. Driving a Ferrari for John Edgar in 1957, Shelby finished second to Fangio in the Cuban GP, and he continued his winning ways in SCCA, overcoming a nasty crash at Riverside in which he sustained facial injuries. 
Tempted back to Europe in 1958, Shelby raced the outdated Maserati 250F, and was unfortunate to be stripped of his points at Monza after taking over Gregorys car to earn a fourth-place finish. He also renewed his association with Aston Martin, finishing third with Lewis-Evans in the Tourist Trophy at Goodwood to set up a full season in both Formula 1 and sports cars in 1959. 
The Grand Prix project was a huge disappointment. Although the front-engined cars were beautifully made, their reliability was suspect and they were unable to compete with the fleet little Coopers. In direct contrast, the sports car programme went well and the Feltham team eventually took the World Sports Car Championship, Carroll playing his part by winning the Le Mans 24 Hours with Salvadori, and the Tourist Trophy at Goodwood with Moss and Fairman. 
In 1960 Shelby competed in SCCA events once more, but by this time he was suffering from heart trouble, and retired at seasons end. It was the beginning of a new chapter, though, as Shelby was to gain even greater fame, first developing the AC Cobra, and then overseeing Fords massive and ultimately successful assault on the Le Mans 24-hour race. 
After many years of failing health, Carroll was literally given a new lease of life in 1990, receiving a successful heart transplant which has since offered him the freedom to travel the world once more and relive his racing days with many old friends and acquaintances.";

In 1958 he acquired an ex-Chico Landi F1 Ferrari and raced it extensively in Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina, and his successes led to an invitation to race in Europe.
Having safely negotiated the French Grand Prix, Fritz crashed and wrote off the Maserati at Silverstone, which cut short his F1 plans for the season, but he later drove the TecMec at Sebring, although he was glad to retire the machine, which he felt was too dangerous. However, wins in Formula Junior at the GP de Messina and in sports cars in the Austrian GP with a Ferrari Testa Rossa led to the 22-year-old d'Orey signing a contract with Ferrari to race their sports cars in 1960.
Describing himself as 'a child and very crazy', Fritz escaped a huge crash at Monza when trying to keep pace with Phil Hill before having a much more serious accident at Le Mans when he slammed his Ferrari into a tree.

So impressed were Maserati that he shared Mantovanis car at that years Italian GP before racing works sports and Grand Prix machines the following season, when he was again sports car champion of Italy, winning the Circuit of Senigallia, and taking second in the Targa Florio and third in the Mille Miglia. In single-seaters he inherited a win in the Pescara GP, and took a fine second place in the Spanish GP at seasons end. For 1955 Musso undertook another busy schedule of racing, scoring points only at Zandvoort, but taking second places in non-championship races at Syracuse, Bordeaux and Naples. Driving the Maserati T300S in sports car events, his only win came at the Monza Supercortemaggiore race with Behra. 
In 1956 Luigi was invited to join the Scuderia Ferrari, and the association began on a high note when he shared the winning car with Fangio in the Argentine GP, following this with a second place in the Syracuse GP. Unfortunately a crash in the Nurburgring 1000 Km left him temporarily sidelined with a broken arm, though he made a contentious 
comeback at Monza, first refusing to hand his car to the waiting Fangio at a pit stop, then taking the lead of the Italian GP only 
for his steering to fail after a tyre threw a tread. 
Something of a nearly-man, outright success seemed continually to elude the Italian in World Championship races in 1957. He was a runner-up in both France and Britain, as well as in the non-title Syracuse and Modena GPs, though he did at last take a victory at Reims in the GP de Marne. This sequence continued into 1958, when a succession of yet more second places (Argentine GP, Buenos Aires City GP, Buenos Aires 1000 Km and Monaco GP) was broken by victory in the Syracuse GP and the Targa Florio. 
After crashing his Ferrari at Spa with tyre failure, Musso arrived at Reims for the French GP determined to make amends, but while he was chasing his team-mate Hawthorn he ran wide on the long Gueux curve at 150 mph. The car ran into a ditch and flipped, killing the driver instantly.";

His rise was meteoric, Mike winning a championship Grand Prix barely two years after his circuit racing debut in a Riley in 1951. During that first full season he won the Leinster Trophy and the Ulster Handicap as well as the Brooklands Memorial Trophy for his consistent successes throughout the year at Goodwood, and for 1952 he took delivery of one of the new Cooper-Bristols, which had been purchased for him by a family friend, Bob Chase. The team would be run by his father Leslie. The season started well with F2 and Libre wins at the Goodwood Easter meeting before he headed for the Continent and fourth place on his Grand Prix debut at Spa. Certainly the car was quite useful, but Mike coaxed far, far more from it than anyone else with his uninhibited driving. 
A minor meeting at Boreham saw a fantastic display of his ability. In pouring rain he left the great Villoresi floundering in his 4.5-litre Ferrari until the track dried and the little Cooper was overhauled. The Italian went back to Italy to report to Ferrari that he had unearthed a new British star. Arriving at Modena for the late-season Grand Prix, Mike was invited to drive for the Scuderia in 1953, and had plenty of time to consider the offer as he crashed the Cooper in practice and found himself hospitalised. He duly joined Ferraris star-studded line-up and wisely took things easy to begin with, watching and learning from his more experienced team-mates. 
It was to be a magnificent first season for the Englishman abroad, and he finished every championship Grand Prix bar one in the points, the highlight being a glorious victory, over Fangio no less, in the French GP at Reims after a wheel-to-wheel battle to the flag. Beyond the World Championship, Hawthorn won the International Trophy and the Ulster Trophy at Dundrod, while in sports cars he took the Spa 24 Hours with Farina, his achievements earning him a BRDC Gold Star. The 1954 season began badly when he crashed at Syracuse and received serious burns to his arms and legs, and there was then a furore over his exemption from National Service due to a kidney ailment followed by the death of his father in a road accident. Mike decided that it would be impossible to run the family garage business if he stayed at Maranello so, after signing off with a win at Pedralbes, he looked forward to racing for Vanwall in 1955, but the new car needed development and Mike was seriously unimpressed with the disarray of Vandervells organisation. Even in victory he was followed by controversy, for when he won the Le Mans 24 Hours for Jaguar with Ivor Bueb he found the finger of blame pointed towards him as the unwitting instigator of the tragedy which killed more than eighty people. Some semblance of order was restored with an end-of-season return to Ferrari by way of the Lancia team which they had just taken over, and a splendid drive for Jaguar in the Tourist Trophy. 
His desire to honour his contract with the sports car team for 1956 meant Mike had to join BRM for Formula 1, and the cars unreliability restricted him to just a handful of outings. Hawthorn decided that for success he must drive for an Italian team, and he was welcomed back to Ferrari to drive alongside his great mate Peter Collins. The atmosphere, so strained in 1956, was completely changed with Mikes return and soon he was back to his consistent best. The magnificent Fangio bestrode the 1957 season in his Maserati, but when the Argentinian retired early in 1958 the title was there to be taken. Ironically the threat to Ferrari came from Vanwall, who had been so shambolic during Mikes brief tenure as a driver. He paced himself brilliantly, taking risks when necessary but making sure that he finished at all costs. The death of Collins in the German GP hit him very hard and, with Musso and Lewis-Evans also having lost their lives that year, Hawthorn, newly crowned as World Champion, announced his retirement. 
Mike was planning both marriage and an expansion of his garage business when, on a rainy January morning in 1959, he lost control of his potent Jaguar near Guildford and was killed instantly when it wrapped itself around a tree.";
570;"Juan Manuel Fangio";26;24.6.1911;"Балькарсе, Буэнос-Айрес";;;;;"17.07.1995";"Балькарсе, Буэнос-Айрес";"Фанхио всегда будут называть Маэстро - и, безусловно, по праву. Этим почетным прозвищем он обязан не только феноменальным достижениям в гонках Больших призов - пять чемпионских титулов и 24 победы из 51 старта - но и тому, какую ауру он создавал вокруг себя, находясь вне кокпита; память об этом жива и по сей день.
Он был простого происхождения. Сын итальянского эмигранта, он вырос в Аргентине, и с раннего детства окунулся в атмосферу автогонок - с 11 лет начал работать в гараже, чтобы поддержать семью. Он откладывал все, что мог, и сумел приобрести Ford T, за рулем которого втайне от всех участвовал в гонках, а затем пересел на Ford V8 special - это и стало началом его настоящей карьеры в мире автоспорта. При поддержке земляков из своего родного города, Балькарсе, он обзавелся Chevrolet, и в 1940 г. выиграл дорожную гонку Gran Premio del Norte протяженностью 5900 миль - это был его первый значительный успех. В течение последующих семи лет он участвовал еще в трех марафонах на Chevrolet, частенько соревнуясь с братьями Гальвес за высшие награды.
Когда в 1948 г. Варци, Виллорези, Фарина и Вимилль были приглашены участвовать в гонках серии Libre, их соперником из местных гонщиков был именно Фанхио; он выступал настолько хорошо, что в 1948 г. правительство спонсировало его поездку в Европу вместе с Гальвес. В Реймсе он управлял Simca-Gordini, а по возвращении домой пересел на Maserati 4CLT.
В 1949 г. он отправился в Европу и, в возрасте 38 лет, провел ошеломляющий дебютный сезон, выиграв первую же для себя гонку в Сан-Ремо, а затем записав на свой счет победы в Перпиньяне, Марселе, По, Альби и Монце. Подобные успехи позволили ему получить место в команде Alfa Romeo в 1950 г., и в чемпионате мира, он занял вторую строчку, уступив только Фарине - несмотря на то, что в шести гонках трижды финишировал победителем. В составе Alfa он добивался триумфа также в Пескаре, Женеве и Сан-Ремо, а за рулем Maserati - в По и Ангулеме. В 1951 г. Фанхио на довоенном Mercedes выступил в начале сезона в гонках Libre в Аргентине, после чего завоевал свой первый из пяти титулов - до того, как Alfa ушла из соревнований.
В 1952 г. свежеиспеченный чемпион доминировал в гонках серии Libre, проходивших на его родном континенте, и шесть раз праздновал победу - в Аргентине, Бразилии и Уругвае, а затем вернулся в Европу, чтобы выступать за Maserati. Однако на Гран При Монцы он попал в серьезную аварию, был выброшен из машины, контужен и, получив перелом шейного позвонка, чудом остался в живых. Остаток сезона он провел в Балькарсе, поправляя здоровье; у него было достаточно времени, чтобы на досуге поразмыслить над тем, как же тонка грань, отделяющая триумф от катастрофы, но и это не помешало ему составить на 1953 год еще более плотное гоночное расписание. На Гран При Италии и Модены он привел Maserati A6GCM к победе и, кроме того, воспользовался случаем тряхнуть стариной и выиграл дорожную гонку Carrera Panamericana за рулем заводской Lancia.
Его талант не имел себе равных, и, когда в 1954 г. компания Mercedes-Benz вернулась в гонки, она поспешила воспользоваться своим приоритетом и заключила с Фанхио контракт. Пока Mercedes готовил автомобили, аргентинец продолжал выступать за Maserati и в первых двух гонках сезона финишировал победителем; за рулем серебряной стрелы он завоевал еще четыре победы. Сочетание врожденного дара Фанхио с немецкими технологиями не оставляло соперникам шансов, и, если он финишировал, то финишировал победителем. Его талант был настолько велик, что поговаривали, будто он сам позволил своим напарникам Клингу и Моссу одержать победы на АФУС и в Эйнтри соответственно; однако, на самом деле, он бы никогда не допустил подобного. Несмотря на то, что он в своем возрасте уже считался сравнительно старым по меркам Гран При, ему вполне по силам было сохранять свое доминирующее положение; казалось, он был неутомим и с легкостью мог приспособиться к любой ситуации. Если бы на пути к цели нужно было свернуть горы, Фанхио сделал бы это; благодаря своей физической силе и выносливости он мог выдержать испепеляющую жару и проливной дождь, а предельная сосредоточенность позволяла оставить далеко позади соперников, если с машиной не было никаких проблем, и дотащить машину до клетчатого флага, если возникали какие-либо механические неприятности, в то время как менее сильные духом давно бы отказались от борьбы.
Помимо этого, Фанхио хватало проницательности, чтобы выбрать лучшую машину из всех доступных и выжать из нее все, что возможно. Даже не самый удачный сезон 1956 года, проведенный в Scuderia Ferrari, когда его чуть было не потеснили молодые итальянские соперники, не помешал ему завоевать свой четвертый титул чемпиона мира; однако в 1957 г. он вернулся в Maserati и, выжав из 250F все, на что та была способна, завоевал свое пятое и, пожалуй, самое захватывающее чемпионство; лучшим моментом того сезона стала, несомненно, одна из самых блестящих гонок за всю историю чемпионата, когда на Нюрбургринге он разгромил Хоторна и Коллинза и выиграл Гран При Германии, рискнув заехать на пит-стоп для смены шин, в то время как соперники на Ferrari предпочли не останавливаться - и именно тактика Фанхио оказалась победной. Его собственные требования к себе были таковы, что на каждой трассе он намеревался улучшить свой предыдущий результат. Он был чемпионом мира, и это было вполне предсказуемо, но на Гран При Италии даже он не смог противостоять Стирлингу Моссу, который к тому моменту практически не уступал ему в мастерстве. У Мосса было преимущество в виде одного из новых Vanwall, в Пескаре ему удалось повторить свой триумф, и для Фанхио это стало зловещим предзнаменованием. Возвращаться в Ferrari он не хотел, Maserati сворачивала свою гоночную деятельность, и он начал задумываться о выходе на пенсию, но, в конце концов, принял решение выступить и в 1958 г. - как независимый участник, выбирая, в каких гонках выходить на старт. На Гран При Аргентины он занял четвертое место, после чего в серии Libre завоевал Большой приз Буэнос-Айреса - и эта победа стала для него последней. Затем он соблазнился поездкой в Индианаполис, желая принять участие в знаменитой гонке на 500 миль, и, несмотря на то, что машина ему досталась далеко не новая, он смог должным образом пройти квалификацию; однако с автомобилем ему все-таки не повезло. Правда, ему пришлось срочно вернуться домой по делам своего гаражного бизнеса - и, вероятно, к счастью, так как та гонка ознаменовалась трагедией из-за массовой аварии на первом круге.
Фанхио суждено было провести еще одну гонку Гран При - последнюю, но, возможно, одну из лучших. Он пришел к финишу четвертым, и победитель той гонки, Хоторн, практически обогнал его на круг на самом финише - но в последние секунды тот предпочел избавить аргентинца от подобного унижения. Однако зрители не знали, что у Фанхио еще в самом начале гонки возникли проблемы со сцеплением. По ходу гонки Маэстро вынужден был положиться на слух, по звуку мотора, работавшего на 8000 оборотах в минуту, определяя момент, в который нужно было переключать передачу - прекрасная иллюстрация его легендарного чувства автомобиля. Он уехал домой, в Балькарсе, с тем, чтобы никогда больше не вернуться на трассу, решив, что самое время остановиться. Его присутствие, несомненно, украшало все мероприятия, на которых он появлялся в дальнейшем; он каким-то чудесным способом притягивал к себе и молодых, и старых, и все они понимали, что общаются не только с легендарным автогонщиком, но и по-настоящему искренним человеком, с благородным сердцем, которому обязан весь спортивный мир.";

After all, he had spent a couple of seasons competing in a Cooper-Bristol - albeit usually in second-division races, with the notable exception of the 1954 British GP. So for 1955 he took himself off to Modena and bought a Maserati 250F, living a hand-to-mouth existence and scrounging parts from the factory to keep his machine on the grid. 
Horace enjoyed a nomadic three seasons on the Continent, entering selected Grands Prix (his best result was fifth at Silverstone in 1956) and cannily entering his Maser in non-championship races where starting money was good and the chances of decent placings were high. Horace finished third at Albi and fourth at Syracuse in 1955, second at Naples in 1956 and fourth, behind the three works Ferraris of Hawthorn, Collins and Musso, in the same race in 1957. Once the factory withdrew, it was really the end for Could, who could no longer gain the assistance he needed to keep running the car. His last hurrah was a fourth place at Syracuse in 1958, though he was tempted back just one more time - to the boycotted 1960 Italian GP - where the old Maserati failed even to turn a wheel in practice due to crossed fuel-lines. Horace, who later helped his son in his racing activities, died of a sudden heart attack in 1968.";
573;"Peter Collins";1;6.11.1931;"Киддерминстер, Уорчестершир";;;;;"03.08.1958";"Бонн, Германия";"Peter Collins death at the Nurburgring in August 1958, just two weeks after his wonderful performance at the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, left the racing world shocked. For although he was indisputably one of the fastest men around, he was also regarded as being one of the safest. 
Handsome and congenial, the young Collins graduated from the 500 cc school, driving Coopers and then the JBS-Norton in 1951, both on the circuits and in hill-climbs, winning his class with BTD at Prescott and Shelsley Walsh. 
With Formula 2 effectively becoming the premier racing class in 1952, John Heath of HWM signed the promising Collins to partner Moss and Macklin in a three-car team which roamed the Continent over the next two seasons. Peter proved to be extremely quick, but the cars were fragile and decent finishes were few and far between, though he managed a second place at Les Sables dOlonne in 1952 and a third at the Eifelrennen the following year. 
Collins potential had been spotted by Aston Martin, who took him into their sports car squad with immediate results. Sharing a DB5 with Pat Griffiths, he won the 1952 BARC Goodwood 9 Hours and the 1955 Tourist Trophy, and he achieved many other good results (including second places at Le Mans in 1955 with Frere and in 1956 with Moss) in what was to be a very happy association with the team. 
In 1954 Peter was recruited by Tony Vandervell to drive his Ferrari Thinwall Special, with which he was to delight British crowds in the popular Libre events of the day, winning at Snetterton and Goodwood. He was also one of the first to handle the new Vanwall Special, but at this stage it was still very much in its infancy. Having found him a constant thorn in their flesh in Libre racing, BRM signed him for a full season in 1955, but in the event their programme was behind schedule, and he mainly raced the Owen teams Maserati 250F until the P25 was ready. Late in the year Collins ran the new car in the Gold Cup at Oulton Park where it proved staggeringly quick before he retired it, erroneously as it turned out, due to a lack of oil pressure. 
Peter accepted the chance to join Ferrari in 1956 alongside the great Fangio with glee, and the Maestro was to have a big influence on his racing. From then on he began to take a much more serious attitude to his craft, though thankfully he never lost his fun-loving, light-hearted spirit off the track. For a new boy at the Scuderia, he settled in very quickly. After handing his machine to Fangio at Monaco, Collins took Grand Prix wins in Belgium and France and then shared second place at Silverstone. Although he drew a blank at the Nurburgring, come the Italian GP at Monza he still had an outside chance of the championship. When Fangio was forced to retire his car early in the race, Peter was asked to hand his car over to the Argentinian at a pit stop and did so without hesitation, even though it meant the end of his own title bid. His actions were particularly appreciated by Enzo Ferrari, who had a special affection for the loyal Englishman from that moment on. However, the 1957 season was not one of the Scuderias better ones, and Peter scored Formula 1 wins only in the relatively minor Syracuse and Naples Grands Prix, and third places in France and Germany, where Fangio put on such an unforgettable display. 
The following season began promisingly for Collins with sports car victories in the Buenos Aires 1000 Km and the Sebring 12 Hours, driving with Phil Hill. Peter had already raced the new Ferrari Dino 246 at the tail-end of the previous year, finishing fourth in the Modena GP, and a win in the International Trophy race at Silverstone boded well for a Ferrari revival. Arriving at the Nurburgring for the German Grand Prix, Peter lay third in the championship standings behind Mike Hawthorn and Stirling Moss, but in the race, with Tony Brooks leading in the Vanwall and Peter in hot pursuit, it seems he made a simple but costly error of judgement, clipping a bank, which somersaulted the car at over 100 mph over a hedge and down into a field. The luckless Collins was hurled from his machine, suffering severe head injuries from which he died soon after in hospital in Bonn, without regaining consciousness.";

He spent five seasons in this cut-and-thrust environment before Connaught gave him a chance to race at the end of 1956. 
Encouraging early-season performances in the Connaught, including victory in the Richmond Trophy at Goodwood and fourth place in the Monaco Grand Prix, then took Stuart into the Vanwall team for the rest of 1957. Some of his drives were brilliant, for example at Naples, where he led Hawthorn, and Reims, where he finished third. In World Championship races he displayed a rare blend of speed and finesse, but had only a fifth at Pescara to show for his efforts. 
Although a slight, frail figure, Lewis-Evans embarked on a daunting racing programme in 1958, competing successfully in Formula 2 for BRP and in sports cars for Aston Martin, in addition to driving for Vanwall in Grands Prix. He played a crucial part in gaining the constructors championship for the team but, in what should have been a glorious finale to the year in Morocco, Lewis-Evans car crashed in flames after its transmission had locked. The poor driver was extricated from the wreckage suffering from terrible burns and, despite being flown back to England for expert attention, he succumbed some six days later.";

In fact Gerini was not to reappear in Grands Prix until 1958, when, apart from a distant sixth place at Caen, he struggled to make an impression in the by now elderly 250F. He briefly reappeared in sports cars in 1960, when his Ferrari crashed out of the Nurburgring 1000 Km.";

Paul, a 500 cc racer of some note, developed an Emeryson-Alta in 1956, in which he finished second, to Moss no less, at Crystal Palace before racing it in the British Grand Prix.

He made his Formula 1 debut in 1955, taking seventh place in the Syracuse GP in a works Maserati 250F, before purchasing a car for the 1956 season, in which he proved hopelessly slow, especially in the Argentine GP where he continually balked faster cars, eventually colliding with Collins Ferrari. Later he caused a furore at the Italian GP by using his car to push Moss fuel-starved machine into the pits and thus give the Englishman a chance to win the race.

В сезоне 1928 года он одержал победы на Гран При Рима, Марны, Испании и Италии, а в 1929 г. закрепил успех триумфами на Гран При Германии и Испании. За рулем Delage он выступил в Индианаполисе и, после затянувшейся остановки для смены шин, финишировал седьмым. В 1930 г. его снова ждал успех – он записал на свой счет победы на Гран При Европы и Лиона, а в 1931 г., все еще на Bugatti, он блестяще финишировал первым на Гран При Монако, а на Гран При Франции разделил триумф с Варци.  
В 1933 г. Широн соблазнился предложением от Scuderia Ferrari и гонял на их Alfa Romeo вплоть до 1936 года – до тех пор, пока мощь Mercedes и Auto Union не стала поистине неодолимой. В последние годы перед войной он практически перестал принимать участие в гонках – правда, для победы на Гран При Франции за рулем спортивного Talbot в 1937 г. он все-таки нашел время. 
После войны, как только представилась возможность, Широн еще раз вышел на старт на своем Talbot. В 1946 г. полного успеха ему добиться не удалось, но в 1947 г. он стал победителем на Гран При Франции в Монлери, а два года спустя он повторил этот триумф в Реймсе. В 1950 г. – первом сезоне только-только зародившегося чемпионата мира – Широн выступал на Maserati 4CLT, особо впечатляющих результатов не добился, за исключением третьего места в своем родном Монте-Карло. В следующем сезоне после первого же Гран При он сменил Maserati на старый добрый Talbot-Lago, но машина оказалась крайне ненадежной. Сезон 1952 г. начался с катастрофы – в Сиракузах его Maserati-Plate охватил огонь, и гонщик получил серьезные ожоги ног. Остаток сезона он провел вне трассы, но уже в 1953 г. вернулся в строй, на этот раз за рулем последней модели OSCA для F2, которая, несмотря на внешнюю привлекательность, совершенно не оправдала возложенных на нее ожиданий.  
К старту сезона 1954 г. Широн подошел в возрасте 54 лет, но он все еще мог побеждать, что и подтвердил триумфом в ралли Монте-Карло на Lancia. Получив приглашение выступить в 1955 г. на Гран При Монако за рулем заводской Lancia, он финишировал шестым. Когда он наконец оставил гонки, принц Ренье попросил его принимать участие в организации двух самых значительных гоночных событий княжества, чем Широн и занимался вплоть до Гран При Монако 1979 г. – а всего месяц спустя его не стало.";

He shared a works car with Behra in the 12-hour race at Casablanca that year, but it was retired with a broken shock absorber. 
Joining the ever-changing roster of pilots at Gordini, Guelfi was given a single appearance at Pescara in 1954, but his race ended on the first lap when the car caught fire. His true metier was sports cars, however, and, with Jacky Pollet, he drove a works Gordini into sixth place at Le Mans, taking the 2000 cc-3000 cc class win. Though still racing mainly in Morocco - he was champion in 1955 - Andre continued to make regular sorties to France. In 1957 he finished a distant seventh in the Pau GP as the pale-blue machines were reaching imminent extinction. The new rear-engined Coopers were now the way forward and Guelfi made a good impression when he took second place in the Prix de Paris at Montlhery in June 1958, only three seconds behind Henry Taylor in a similar car. With a Formula 2 class being added to bolster the field for the first (and only) Grand Prix of Morocco at seasons end, Guelfi entered a car, but in truth was not as quick as could have been expected, though he stayed the distance to finish last.

He often charged into the lead at the start of a race, only to be overhauled as his tyres gave out or the car cried enough in response to the punishing treatment to which it had been subjected. 
Having been presented with a Ferrari sports car by a local benefactor in 1950 when aged only 20, Eugenio entered the spotlight in 1952 with a win in the Portuguese GP, third place in the Bari GP and second in the Monaco GP (held for sports cars that year), as well as a class win in the Circuit of Sicily. The following season saw him claim the first of his three Italian mountain championships, win the Messina 10 Hours in a Ferrari and finish third in the Carrera Panamericana in a Lancia. 
Castellotti signed for Lancia for 1954, racing sports cars while waiting patiently for the chance to drive one of their much anticipated Grand Prix cars. In fact it was 1955 before he got his wish, making his Grand Prix debut at the Argentine GP, where he suffered from sun-stroke in the intense heat and finally crashed the car. Back in Europe, however, he made amends, finishing fourth in the Turin GP and second at Pau and - after Ascari had crashed his car into the harbour - Monaco. Days later Ascari was killed in a testing accident, and Castellotti led the team for one race, at Spa, before it was amalgamated with the Scuderia Ferrari, for whom he finished the season, taking third in the drivers championship. 
The 1956 season saw the Ferrari squad almost embarrassed by an over-supply of cars and drivers, which led to some friction within the team. This was particularly acute between Musso and Castellotti, the two Italians waging their own private duel in the Italian GP at Monza. Eugenio was by now at his peak, particularly in sports cars. A stunning win in atrocious conditions in the Mille Miglia made up in part for his disappointment the previous year when he destroyed his tyres racing too hard too early. Added to this was a victory in the Sebring 12 Hours and second in the Nurburgring 1000 Km (both with Fangio). 
More sports car success lay ahead in 1957, Eugenio sharing the first and third cars in the Buenos Aires 1000 Km.

For 1952 Simon joined Ferrari but raced in only a few events, although he did share the winning T500 with Ascari at Comminges, and took second place in the Paris GP and the Autodrome GP at Monza, and fourth in the Monaco sports car race. 
From 1953 on, Andre raced intermittently as an independent in both Grands Prix and sports car events, taking a third for Gordini in the 1954 International Trophy. In 1955 he replaced the injured Herrmann in the Mercedes at short notice at Monaco and also raced the German teams sports cars, taking third in the Tourist Trophy. Driving a Maserati 250F, Simon won the Albi GP in 1955, but it was by then a much less important event than in previous years. He raced in a few more Grands Prix without success, his last decent placing being second in the rain-soaked 1956 Caen GP in a Gordini.

His only Grand Prix appearance came in 1957 at Reims (a track he disliked due to the fact that the edges of the flat, fast bends were hard to see) when his car was taken over in mid-race by Jack Brabham, but later in the year he finished second in the Prix de Paris at Montlhery. 
After a lengthy period away from racing, he returned to action on the hill-climb scene in 1968, winning the RAC championships in 1973 and 74 in his potent 5-litre Repco-engined Brabham BT36X.

Settling in London, he soon integrated himself into the British motor racing scene, driving for Colin Chapmans fledgling sports car team at home and taking in a number of races on the Continent in his own Ferrari and Bonniers Maserati during 1956. However, he really made a name for himself in the Reims 12-hour race, which he led superbly in Buebs Lotus until engine troubles intervened.

Поначалу он неразрывно был связан с семейством Райли, но после войны решил действовать самостоятельно и за рулем ERA трижды становился победителем British Empire Trophy – в 1947, 1948 и 1949 гг., и один раз, в 1949 г. одержал победу в Jersey Road Race. В том же году Боб вплотную приблизился к первому месту на Гран При Великобритании, финишировав вторым вслед за де Граффенридом.  
В самом начале пятидесятых годов он дважды привел старенькую ERA к шестому месту в гонках Гран При, но этот автомобиль уже годился исключительно для участия в национальных соревнованиях, так что Джерарду пришлось ждать 1953 г., когда он, желая наконец проявить себя, обзавелся Cooper-Bristol. За рулем этого автомобиля он частенько вгонял в стыд владельцев более мощных автомобилей и регулярно занимал достойные уважения места во второстепенных гонках Формулы 2 и серии Libre вплоть до 1956 г. 
В последний раз Джерард вышел на старт Гран При в 1957 г., управляя совершенно неудачным Cooper-BG-Bristol с задним расположением двигателя и не набрав ни одного очка. С 1959 по 1961 он успешно выступал в клубных гонках на Turner, а затем стал постепенно сворачивать свою активную деятельность; какое-то время он управлял Cooper Джона Тейлора, в основном в незачетных гонках, и появлялся в Формуле 2, выступая за команды Алана Роллинсона, Майка Беквита и Питера Гетина.";

His best single-seater result was a second place in the Albi GP with a Ferrari T375 in 1952, a season which also saw him gain a string of fine placings at home. Landi raced on into the late fifties, before retiring to become a leading figure in the administration of Brazilian motor sport.";

In single-seaters he finished fifth in the 1956 International Trophy and did well to claim points at Monaco, but achieved little else, while in sports car racing he scored a win for the team at Montlhery against very poor opposition.
Equipe Gordini were on their last legs early in 1957, but Ramos took sixth place at Pau in the streamliner before their demise, and returned in an Alan Brown Cooper the following year to finish second.

After missing the early-season Argentine races due to appendicitis, Perdisa was back in harness by Monaco, but again his points finishes were due in part to the efforts of another driver, this time Moss. Cesare was injured in a practice crash at the German Grand Prix and did not race for the Maserati team again. Lining up for rivals Ferrari in Argentina at the start of 1957, he took a shared sixth place in the Grand Prix, seventh in the Buenos Aires City GP, and won the 1000-km sports car race with co-drivers Gregory, Castellotti and Musso. However, on returning to Europe, perhaps due to pressure from his family, Cesare suddenly announced his retirement from racing.";
615;"Robert  Manzon";10;12.4.1917;"Марсель";;;;;"";"";"В 1947 г. Манзон ездил на собственной 1100-кубовой Cisitalia, одержал победы в Ангулеме и Комменже, и своими выступлениями в других гонках на Simca Gordini произвел впечатление на Эмиди, достаточное, чтобы тот предложил ему контракт в середине сезона 1948 г. В своей первой же гонке, на Circiut des Ramparts в Ангулеме (где он всегда выступал блестяще), он захватил лидерство и показал лучшее время на круге, но, к сожалению, сошел. 
Он стал первым номером в команде, в 1949 г. в Ангулеме финишировал вторым вслед за Тринтиньяном, в Лозанне снова занял второе место, уступив Соммеру, а в Монлери на Bol d’Or одержал победу за рулем серийного спортивного автомобиля Simca с особым 1000-кубовым мотором. Эти машины слыли ненадежными потому, что их двигатели не выдерживали большой нагрузки, но уж если выдерживали, то показывали неплохие результаты. В 1950 г. Манзон занял четвертое место в Реймсе на Гран При Франции, входившем в зачет чемпионата мира, а в Формуле 2 выиграл Гран При Перигей на трассе Метте в Бельгии, занял второе место в Рубэ и третье – на Гран При Швейцарии в Бремгартене. Годом спустя ему досталась всего лишь одна победа за весь сезон, снова на Метте, но в Ле Сабль д’Олон, Руане и Кадуре он был вторым.  
В 1952 г. Gordini представила новый шестицилиндровый автомобиль, внеся тем самым дополнительную остроту в соревнования. Роберт смог извлечь неплохую пользу из новой машины, удачно финишировав в нескольких гонках чемпионата мира – например, в Спа он занял прекрасное третье место, уступив только заводским Ferrari. В незачетных гонках самым высоким его достижением стало второе место в Марселе, которое он занял вместе с Бира, а на спортивном Gordini он выиграл Coupe de Salon в Монлери. На Гран При Аргентины в начале 1953 г. он провел одно из лучших выступлений за всю свою карьеру – всю гонку он шел просто великолепно и занимал второе место, когда у его машины вдруг отвалилось колесо. В гонке серии Libre в Буэнос-Айресе он финишировал пятым, а по возвращении во Францию покинул команду и до конца года выступал на спортивных автомобилях Lancia, после чего, в 1954 г., вошел в состав команды Луи Розье. Лучшим его результатом, без всякого сомнения, стало третье место в Реймсе, когда после ошеломительной дебютной гонки он финишировал позади двух Mercedes-Benz – даже несмотря на то, что Бордо он был вторым, уступив только Гонзалесу на заводском Ferrari. 
В 1955 г. он вернулся «в родные пенаты», к «Чародею» Гордини, но, к сожалению, особых успехов добиться не смог – лучшим финишем стало пятое место в Бордо. На следующий год в Монако его подстерегало куда большее разочарование – он шел третьим, когда за три круга до финиша отказала коробка передач. Ему удалось записать на свой счет еще пару побед – на Гран При Неаполя, где он стал лидером после схода заводских Ferrari, и в гонке спортивных автомобилей в Пескаре, где за рулем двухлитровой машины после блестяще проведенной борьбы он смог превзойти Ferrari Таруффи. В конце сезона недооцененный Манзон решил оставить автоспорт ради семьи и бизнеса.";

Имея в арсенале собственноручно подготовленный Talbot, Розье в 1947 г. выиграл Гран При Альби, в то время как куда более быстрые соперники сходили один за другим, и эта победа во многом определила развитие всей его последующей карьеры, ибо он обычно ездил, не выходя за рамки своих возможностей, и придавал большое значение стратегии и надежности, считая их основой успеха. В 1948 г. в составе команды Ecurie France за рулем одноместного Lago-Talbot он одержал победу на Гран При Салона и финишировал четвертым на Гран При Комменджа, По и Бельгии. В следующем сезоне, когда Talbot на голову превосходил всех соперников, Розье стал победителем Гран При Бельгии и, после череды стабильных финишей, завоевал титул чемпиона Франции и удерживал его за собой на протяжении четырех лет.  
В 1950 г., первом сезоне чемпионата мира, балом правила Alfa Romeo, но хитроумный Розье всегда умудрялся занимать высокие места и записал на свой счет несколько неплохих финишей в очковой зоне в гонках чемпионата, а также победы в Гран При Альби и Голландии. Приспособив свой Talbot под технические требования гонок спортивных автомобилей, он вместе со своим сыном Жаном-Луи в том же сезоне стал победителем в 24 часах Ле-Мана – и надо отдать должное отцу, которому принадлежала львиная доля успеха, ведь он управлял машиной на протяжении 20 часов. К 1951 году Talbot уже не мог составить серьезную конкуренцию соперникам, однако Луи по-прежнему удавалось каким-то загадочным образом уговаривать старенький автомобиль финишировать с удивительным постоянством, и он дважды праздновал победу – в Гран При Голландии и Бордо. 
1952 год принес изменения в регламенте, и Розье, не теряя времени даром, обзавелся Ferrari T375 и замечательной Ferrari T500, предназначенной для выступлений в Ф2. Итальянские машины были быстренько покрашены в традиционный французский синий цвет, и Розье не замедлил извлечь из них пользу, одержав победу на Гран При Альби за рулем модели с большим объемом двигателя. В 1953 г. он продолжил выступать на этих же автомобилях, записал на свой счет еще одну победу на Гран При Альби, дополнил список победных финишей триумфом на Гран При Сабль д’Олон, одержанным на T500, и вывел свой старенький Talbot на старт 12-часовой гонки в Реймсе, где вместе с Жиро-Кабанту занял второе место.  
К тому моменту лучшие годы Розье как гонщика уже миновали, однако в следующем сезоне он с присущей ему настойчивостью бесстрашно выходил на старт, и, выступив несколько раз на Ferrari 625, приобрел Maserati 250F, за рулем которой продолжил участвовать в гонках Гран При и незачетных соревнованиях – все в той же свойственной ему уверенной и надежной манере, а также выступал на собственной 3-литровой спортивной Ferrari. По иронии судьбы последнюю победу Розье одержал в 1956 г. в гонке “1000 км Парижа” на Maserati T300S вместе с Бера, после чего вышел на старт в Монлери – на трассу, которую он прекрасно знал – за рулем Ferrari в составе Coupe de Salon. Под проливным дождем машина Розье перевернулась, он получил серьезные травмы головы, от которых скончался три недели спустя после аварии. Посмертно был награжден французским Орденом Нации.";

He made his debut in the Spa 24 Hours, sharing an MG with Jacques Swaters, the pair finishing fourth in class, but it was not until 1952 that he raced in earnest. After winning a big production car race in an Oldsmobile at Spa, Frere picked up a last-minute drive with HWM in the GP des Frontieres at Chimay. Left at the start, he overhauled Downings Connaught right at the death to score a surprise win. HWMs John Heath immediately offered Paul a drive in the forthcoming Belgian GP and he delighted his entrant by bringing the car home in fifth place in pouring rain. 
Frere raced for HWM again in 1953; his luck was out this time in Grands Prix, but he did finish a brilliant second in the rain in the Eifelrennen. For 1954 he accepted a few rides with Gordini in F1, and drove at Le Mans for the first time in an Aston Martin sports car. 
The Sarthe classic was to become an important race in Freres career. Second in the tragic 1955 race in an Aston, he was involved in a first-lap crash in a works Jaguar in 1956, finished fourth in 1957 and 58, second again in an Aston in 1959, and finally won in 1960 sharing a works Ferrari with Gendebien. This partnership incidentally was also victorious in the Reims 12 Hours of 1957. 
Ferrari also gave Paul an opportunity to drive his Formula 1 cars, and he did not disappoint, taking fourth place in the 1955 Belgian GP and a quite magnificent second behind Peter Collins at Spa again in 1956. He made a return to single-seaters in 1960, his final season, winning the South African GP in an Equipe Nationale Beige Cooper, then showing his consistency and reliable driving skills on his return to Europe to take fifth places at Syracuse and Brussels and sixth at Pau.";
622;"Luigi  Villoresi";7;16.5.1909;"Милан";;;;;"24.08.1997";"Модена";"Успехи и трагедии в равной мере сопровождали всю 25-летнюю карьеру «Джиджи» Виллорези, седого итальянца, чей пик славы пришелся на первые же послевоенные годы. Он начал участвовать в гонках в далеком 1931 г. на машинах Fiat, после чего отдал предпочтение марке, принесшей ему знаменитость – Maserati. Было это в 1936 г., и к тому времени он и его брат Эмилио уже успели заработать себе репутацию этакой дикой парочки. Тем не менее Луиджи выиграл Гран При Брно для вуатюретт в Чехословакии в 1937 г., чтобы получить возможность войти в состав команды Maserati Gran Prix. Он дважды становился чемпионом Италии в 1500-кубовом классе – в 1938 и 1939 гг., а также одержал победы на Гран При Альби, Пескары и Южной Африки. Помимо этого, он стал победителем Targa Florio в 1939 и 1940 гг., снова на Maserati, однако тот период был омрачен гибелью Эмилио, выступавшего в то время в качестве его соперника за команду Alfa Romeo.  
Во время войны Виллорези побывал в плену, а после освобождения вновь устремил все свои помыслы к гонкам. Вскоре он и Фарина уже оспаривали друг у друга звание быстрейшего гонщика Италии, а вместе с Вимиллем он был признан лучшим в мире. В 1946 г. за рулем своей Maserati он стал победителем в Ницце и на Circuit of Voghera, вывел трехлитровый 8CL на старт в Индианаполисе, где занял седьмое место, а годом спустя записал на свой счет победы в Буэнос-Айресе, Мар-дель-Плата, Ниме, Ницце, Страсбурге и Люксембурге. В сезоне 1948 года он попал в серьезную аварию в Бремгартене, чудом уцелел, а на следующий год уже праздновал триумф в качестве чемпиона Италии. Он одержал победы в двух гонках в Буэнос-Айресе, Коммендже, Альби, Силверстоуне (первом послевоенном Гран При Британии) и Барселоне. После побед в гонках серии Libre в Интерлагосе и Гавеа Виллорези наконец отрекся от своей любимой Maserati в пользу Ferrari, став напарником Аскари и передавая тому секреты своего гоночного мастества. Вскоре он выиграл для Scuderia гонку в Зандфорте на машине с наддувом и гонки Формулы 2 в Брюсселе, Люксембурге, Риме и Гарде. 
Сезоны 1950 и 1951 гг. прошли в попытках угнаться за автомобилями Alfa Romeo, однако Виллорези по-прежнему добивался больших успехов; в 1950 г. за победами в Буэнос-Айресе и Розарио последовал еще больший триумф в Марселе, Эрлене и Монце, следующий год, проведенный на Type 375, также был весьма стабилен и отмечен победами в незачетных гонках в Сиракузах и По. Тот год был вообще удачным для «Джиджи» - он выиграл Милле Милья, в Carrera Panamericana занял второе место, и вместе с Аскари привел Lancia к победе в Sestrieres Rally. В 1952-53 гг. он был вынужден прозябать в тени своего великого ученика Аскари, но все еще неплохо смотрелся на трассе, особенно в Турине и Модене, где финишировал первым.  
В 1954 г. Виллорези вместе с Аскари подписал контракт с Lancia, но команда все никак не могла подготовить машину для гонок Гран При, и та появилась на старте только последней гонки сезона. «Джиджи» тем временем выступал за Maserati, но авария в Милле Милья совсем охладила его пыл. В 1955 г. он продолжил выступать за Lancia, но, после гибели Аскари и последующего слияния команды с Ferrari, в начале 1956 г. остался без места заводского пилота. К тому моменту лучшие его годы были уже позади, но он продолжал выступать на частных Maserati и заводской OSCA в гонках спортивных автомобилей. Во время одной их таких гонок, проходивших в Кастельфузано, его Maserati попала в очередную аварию, и гонщик получил серьезный перелом ноги. Виллорези прислушался к мольбам родственников, просивших его оставить автоспорт, но не смог устоять перед соблазном принять участие в Acropolis Rally в 1958 г., в котором он стал победителем за рулем Lancia.";

На него обратила внимание Ferrari, и на предоставленной ими Alfa Romeo он разгромил Бьондетти в гонке по подъему на холм Coppa Frigo. Он продолжал выступать и на двух колесах, а на Гран При Рима в 1932 г. за рулем Alfa Monza занял второе место, уступив Фаджиоли, и был третьим в Эйфельреннен в 1933 г. 
К 1934 г. он уже управлял заводскими Maserati, но в Триполи попал в аварию и сильно разбился, а в 1935 г. перешел в команду Bugatti и занял третье место в Турине. Таруффи по-прежнему не расставался с мотоспортом, и, хотя в 1937 г. прекратил выступать в гонках, он продолжил работать в качестве управляющего в команде Gilera и до, и после войны. 
С 1947 по 1949 гг. Пьеро очень успешно выступал на Cisitalia Дузио, а в качестве приглашенного гонщика занял для Alfa Romeo четвертое место на Гран При Монцы в 1948 г. В 1949 г., в составе Ferrari, Таруффи финишировал вторым на Гран При Рима в Каракалле за рулем Tipo 166. В 1950 г. он периодически выступал и за Alfa Romeo, заняв для той третье место на Гран При Наций в Женеве, и за Ferrari, и третье место, занятое для этой команды в конце сезона на Гран При Пенья-Рин в Барселоне, принесло ему приглашение выступать в 1951 г. за заводскую команду уже на постоянной основе. Это был последний год доминирования Alfa, но Пьеро занял второе место на Гран При Швейцарии и третье – в незачетном Гран При Бари в Лунгомаре. В гонках спортивных автомобилей он был вторым в Tour of Sicily и вместе с Чинетти на 4,1-литровой машине выиграл Carrera Panamericana. 
Лучшим для Таруффи стал сезон 1952 года. За рулем Tipo 500, созданном, чтобы побеждать, он служил превосходной поддержкой великолепному Аскари, выиграл Гран При Швейцарии в Бремгартене и провел еще несколько отличных гонок, заняв в зачетной таблице чемпионата третью строчку. В других важных гонках одноместных автомобилей Пьеро также добился успехов - одержал победу на Гран При Парижа в Монлери, был вторым в Сиракузах и Неаполе, а в соревнованиях более мощных автомобилей был вторым в Турине и праздновал победу в гонке серии Libre в Силверстоуне за рулем Ferrari Thinwall Special Вандерволла. В 1953 г. он перешел в Lancia, выступал на их спортивных автомобилях, особых успехов не добился, правда, на 3,3-литровой Lancia смог занять второе место в Carrera Panamericana. В 1954 г. дела пошли на лад, что наглядно демонстрировали победы в Targa Florio и Tour of Sicily; в Tour of Sicily он стал победителем еще раз, год спустя, уже за рулем Ferrari.  
Таруффи продолжал периодически появляться в гонках Больших призов, и был надежным гонщиком, на которого можно положиться, поэтому Mercedes предложил ему занять в команде место Ханса Херманна, оставившего гонки – и Пьеро, дважды выйдя на старт на серебряной машине, блестяще финишировал в обеих гонках. В 1956 г. он перешел в команду Maserati, выступал на спортивных автомобилях, вместе с Моссом, Шеллом и Бера финишировал победителем в «1000 км Нюрбургринга» и был вторым в Targa Florio, Circuit of Sicily и на Гран При Пескары. Его последнее выступление в Формуле 1 пришлось на 1957 год, когда на Гран При в Сиракузах за рулем Maserati 250F в составе Scuderia Centro Sud он занял четвертое место, несмотря на сломанный амортизатор. Вскоре после этого Таруффи добился исполнения своего заветного желания – с тринадцатой попытки он одержал победу в злополучной Милле Милья на заводской Ferrari, заменив в последний момент Муссо.

He had made his reputation as national production car champion in 1952 with Lancia, then winning the 1955 Targa Florio and the Carrera Panamericana in 1954 in the marques cars. Despite success at Maranello in hill-climbs and sports car races which included victories in the Pescara 12 Hours, Buenos Aires 1000 Km and Circuit of Mugello, Umberto joined Maserati for 1956, again racing only occasionally in Grands Prix, but he also began the start of a long and fruitful association with Porsche by winning the Targa Florio with von Trips. 
A practice crash at Salzburg in 1957 sidelined him with leg injuries but he bounced back in 1959, winning the Sebring 12 Hours with Hans Herrmann. Little success came Magliolis way in the early sixties, but a return to the Ferrari sports car team in 1963 saw him take third place at Le Mans and in the Nurburgring 1000 Km, followed by another win at Sebring in 1964. 
Throughout the rest of the decade he continued to race a variety of potent machines, including a Ford GT40 and the works Porsche 907, with which, paired with Vie Elford, he won the Targa Florio in 1968, his last major victory.";

As a baby he underwent no fewer than 22 operations to repair and add as much function as possible to his partly formed right arm and badly deformed legs and feet. Determined to lead as full a life as the next man, he was always bursting with vitality and exuberance, and earned a living as a travelling salesman in order to fund his motor sport ambitions. 
Scott-Brown began racing in 1950 in a minor way in an MG TD, but it was 1954 before he began to make his mark, forming a great partnership with Brian Lister to race his Lister-Bristol. Soon Archie was winning club and national events all over the country with the car, and he earned himself a chance in the Connaught F1 team for 1956, taking part in the British Grand Prix and finishing second in the International Trophy race. His performances drew admiration from everyone for the amazing way he handled any type of machinery - Fangio for one thought his car control was phenomenal. 
In 1957, he had the opportunity to race the works BRM in the British GP but, after a brake problem in testing and discussions with friends, he was persuaded to decline the offer. However, he continued to race in sports cars and was now back with Lister, handling his ferocious Lister-Jaguar. 
By this time Scott-Brown was greatly frustrated by his inability to gain an international licence, which stopped him competing abroad. He did obtain permission to race in New Zealand early in 1958, winning the Lady Wigram Trophy, but the following May, when competing in a big sports car race at Spa, he lost control of his Lister on a piece of damp track while dicing with Masten Gregory.

Он даже намеренно преуменьшал свои достижения в 1950 г., принесшем ему чемпионство, лишь бы избежать суматохи, которая должна была за этим последовать.  
К тому моменту, как он завоевал свой первый титул, он был одним из самых «возрастных» пилотов, регулярно появлявшихся на трассе, а его дебют приходился аж на 1932 год, когда он впервые принял участие в гонке по подъему на холм в Аоста-Сент-Бернард. Это был печальный опыт – он разбился и попал в больницу, но той аварии суждено было стать лишь первой из многих, приключившихся с этим жестким аристократичным итальянцем, казавшимся непоколебимым, за всю его долгую карьеру. 
Какое-то время он выступал на Maserati, не добившись, впрочем, впечатляющих результатов; настоящий успех пришел к нему, когда, опекаемый великим Нуволари, он пересел на Alfa Romeo. В то время красные машины сильно уступали мощным немецким автомобилям, и юный Фарина частенько вылетал с трассы после отчаянных попыток не отстать от соперников. Тем не менее, ему удалось выиграть Гран При Неаполя в 1937 г., стать чемпионом Италии в 1937-1939 гг. и успешно выступить на Alfa Romeo 158 на Гран При Антверпена, Коппа Чиано и ГП Берна. В 1939 г. он провел фантастическую гонку на Гран При Швейцарии - за рулем маломощной Alfa держался впереди многих соперников на куда более быстрых автомобилях, пока не вынужден был уступить. Одержав победу в Гран При Триполи, Фарина подбирался к самому пику своей формы, когда война на время положила конец его гоночной деятельности; однако в 1946 г. он снова вышел на трассу и тут же произвел впечатление, став победителем Гран При Наций в Женеве. Энцо Феррари проявил большое внимание к его возможностям – Фарина отличался тем, что даже на высокой скорости жестко вел машину, сидя прямо и держа руль вытянутыми руками.  
В 1948 г. на частной Maserati он одержал победы в Монако, Женеве и Мар-дель-Плата, и на этой же машине вышел на старт следующего сезона, придя к финишу первым на Гран При Лозанны и вторым – в International Trophy; в том же году он выступил и за Ferrari, приведя Tipo 166 к победе на Гран При Розарио. 
Когда в 1950 г. Alfa Romeo вернулась в гонки, Фарина вместе с Фанхио и Фаджиоли сел за руль классических моделей 158 и, продемонстрировав потрясающую отвагу и хладнокровие, стал первым в истории чемпионом мира среди гонщиков. В 1951 году он остался с Alfa, выиграл Гран При Бельгии, но его совершенно затмил Фанхио; с той же проблемой он столкнулся и в следующем году, уйдя в Ferrari. Нино был вынужден болтаться в кильватере проносящегося мимо него Аскари, а победы ему достались только во второстепенных Гран При в Неаполе и Монце. Нельзя сказать, что он был очень счастлив, играя вторую скрипку, но, по правде говоря, ему не удавалось достичь той же скорости, которую демонстрировал его напарник, хотя на Гран При Германии ему удалось одержать блестящую победу после потери колеса. Когда в 1954 г. Аскари ушел в Lancia, у Фарины появилась надежда на очередной титул, особенно после прекрасного начала сезона, ознаменовавшегося победой на Гран При в Сиракузах; однако затем последовала авария в Милле Милья, выздоровление и еще один, очень опасный, инцидент в Монце, когда его машину охватил огонь, и гонщик получил серьезные ожоги ног. 
Он принял мужественное решение вернуться в гонки в 1955 г., даже несмотря на вынужденную необходимость прибегнуть к помощи морфия, потребовавшуюся ему, чтобы завершить Гран При Аргентины, по ходу которого он сменил две машины; в Монако и Спа он также финишировал в очках. Полученные травмы вынудили его в конце года объявить о своем уходе, однако вскоре он снова вернулся, предпринял попытку квалифицироваться в Индианаполисе – без особого, правда, энтузиазма - после чего во время тренировки в Монце на Суперкортемаджоре попал в очередную аварию и получил перелом ключицы. Еще раз поправив здоровье, он вернулся в Инди, но, после того, как в его машину врезался молодой американец Кейт Эндрюс, и последствия оказались роковыми, он утратил интерес к гонкам и навсегда оставил их. Ирония судьбы – пережив множество аварий на трассе, Фарина погиб в дорожной аварии в 1966 г.";

After reaching championship class at tennis, he turned to motor sport with an MG, which was soon replaced by a Mercedes SSK with which he won an important race at Rosario. Racing the ex-Varzi Bugatti, Mieres won the Argentine sports car championship, and as a result was invited to accompany Fangio and Gonzalez on a short trip to Europe, during which he took a Ferrari to fourth in the Geneva GP of 1950. 
Returning home he waited for an opportunity to race abroad once more, which finally came in 1953, when Gordini invited him to replace the injured Behra. Little came his way in terms of results, but he drove brilliantly to finish fourth in the F1 Albi GP with the F2 car. In 1954 Roberto ordered a Maserati 250F, but he started the season with the interim A6GCM/250 and scored a superb second place in the Buenos Aires City GP. He was frustrated by the non-appearance of his new car for most of the year, but made the best of it, taking third at Pau and fourth in the International Trophy at Silverstone. When the 250F eventually arrived, Mieres immediately took fourth places in Swiss and Spanish GPs, so impressing the factory that he was taken on for 1955. 
Ably supporting team leader Jean Behra, Mieres enjoyed a consistent season, doing particularly well in non-championship races, taking second in the Turin GP and third at both Pau and Bordeaux. Political upheaval at home prompted Mieres to retire from Grands Prix at the end of 1955 to tend his business interests, and he returned to his earlier passion of yachting. 
Roberto was tempted back behind the wheel, however. He finished fourth In the 1957 Buenos Aires 1000 Km in the Ecurie Ecosse Jaguar D-Type, while in 1958 he raced a Centro Sud Maserati 250 F in the Buenos Aires City GP, and shared a works Porsche with Barth and dOrey in the 1000 Km, claiming a class win and fifth place overall. 
Mieres subsequently raced occasionally in the USA, and took part in single-seater and saloon car events at home until 1962-63, when he decided to concentrate on his considerable competition yachting skills.";

This led him to buy a Maserati, and he was soon assimilated into the works team, sharing a 2-litre sports car with Fangio to take third in the 1953 Targa Florio, and winning the Circuit of Caserta race. This led to a drive in that years Italian GP, though he had to hand his car over to Musso in the race. 
In 1954 he became a good, solid team member who could be relied upon to look after the car and bring it home, taking fifth places in the German and Swiss Grands Prix, and thirds in both the Syracuse and Rome non-championship events. 
Retained in the squad for 1955, Sergio was involved in a practice crash at the Valentine GP in Turin in which he sustained serious leg injuries which resulted in the amputation of one limb above the knee.

He continued to run this car in the early fifties, but was also involved in trying to race the ill-fated Cisitalia-based Autoar. Bucci took this futuristic rear-engined machine, developed with help from the Peronist government, to some fairly meaningless speed records in July 1953, but it proved completely unraceworthy when it was briefly practiced at the 1954 Buenos Aires City GP. Bucci raced his trusty Alfa instead, but was apparently disqualified for not wearing a crash helmet! 
He came to Europe in mid-1954 to race for Gordini, but had little luck in his four championship races and fared no better in the three non-title events he contested, posting retirements at Pescara, Rouen and Caen. 
Clemar joined the works Maserati team for the 1955 Argentine GP, run in broiling heat, and then finished ninth in a 2.5-litre Ferrari sports car in the Formula Libre GP of Buenos Aires. This event held more interest for the locals than the championship race and drew a crowd estimated at 400,000.

He appears to have driven a Maserati into 16th place in the well-supported Buenos Aires City GP, a Libre event held a couple of weeks after his outing in the French car. 
Thereafter it was back to his Chevrolet special, in which he earned some glory by taking second place in the 500-mile race at Rafaelo in 1956. Two years later he achieved fame of a kind by contriving to collide with Stirling Moss on the opening lap of the Buenos Aires Libre GP. The first heat of the race was started in wet conditions and Iglesias powered from the back of the grid, braking far too late for the first corner. He ran at unabated speed into Mosss Cooper, sending the little machine some three to four feet into the air before it shot off the circuit towards a crowd of photographers.

Он начал выступать на мотоциклах с мотором Bianchi в 1937, затем пилотировал свой первый спортивный автомобиль Ferrari T815 в гонке Милле Милья в 1940 вместе со своим кузеном Миноцци, и эта пара лидировала в своем классе до тех пор, пока не покинула его.  
Война вскоре прервала гонки в Италии, и он продолжил выступления только в 1947. Второе место на маленькой Cisitalia в гонке однотипных машин на острове Гезере позади Кортезе привлекло к нему внимание, и вскоре он производил впечатление своей скоростью, управляя Maserati 4CLT. Своей первой победы он добился в гонке спортивных автомобилей в Модене в том же году, и очень большую пользу принесло ему покровительство со стороны Виллорези, гонщика той же команды, победу над которым ему удалось одержать на Гран При Сан-Ремо в 1948. Он финишировал вторым вслед за своим наставником в Гран При Великобритании, и однажды даже выступил за рулем машины соперников - Alfa Romeo - закончив гонку третьим на Гран При Франции в Реймсе. 
После победы на Гран При Буэнос-Айреса в 1949 в составе Maserati и Аскари, и Виллорези ушли в Ferrari, где талант Альберто засверкал в полной мере. По ходу своего первого сезона за рулем Т125 он выиграл Гран При Швейцарии, Италии и Перона. В 1950 г. Alfa Romeo вернулась в соревнования со своими 158, и Ferrari сосредоточилась на чемпионате Формулы 2, выиграв подряд гонки в Модене, Монце, Риме, Реймсе, Гарде и Нюрбургринге, пока шла разработка их болида Т375, предназначенного для участия в гонках Формулы 1. Хотя он и пришел вторым в Монако, в конце сезона ему удалось одержать победу и на Гран При Пенья Рин в Барселоне на новеньком 4,5-литровом автомобиле.  
В 1951 г. Аскари выиграл два Гран При и, хотя превосходство Alfa Romeo было повержено, чемпионский титул ушел к Фанхио. После изменения ограничений в гонках ГП на 2-литровые машины в 1952 г. и развала команды Alfa положение Альберто стабилизировалось. Его задача по завоеванию чемпионского титула была в дальнейшем облегчена отсутствием травмированного Фанхио, и пропуск ГП Швейцарии всего лишь отодвинул момент триумфа, т.к., выйдя затем на старт в Индианаполисе, выдающийся итальянец довел число своих чемпионских побед до шести, впридачу к победным финишам в Сиракузах, По, Марселе, Комменже и Ля Боле.  
То же самое повторилось и в 1953 г., когда он подавил сопротивление соперников и выиграл еще 5 гонок, добавив победы в По и Бордо к своему быстро растущему победному списку. Полоса везения закончилась в с переходом в Lancia в 1954 г., т. к. команда разочаровала Аскари, затянув подготовку автомобиля до конца сезона. Правда, он одержал победу в гонке Милле Милья на спортивной машине Lancia, и его пригласили в качестве гонщика Maserati и Ferrari, что дало ему возможность провести блестящую гонку в Монце, соперничая с моторами Mersedes.  
С доработанной Lancia на старте сезона 1955 Аскари лидировал на Гран При Аргентины до тех пор, пока не потерял контроль над машиной на скользком асфальте, первенствовал на не входящих в зачет чемпионата Гран При Турина и Неаполя, и лидировал в По, закончив гонку пятым. На Гран При Монако Альберто попал в знаменитую аварию на набережной, упав в залив и получив лицевые травмы, однако четырьмя днями позже он неожиданно вернулся в Монцу, чтобы тестировать спортивный автомобиль Ferrari в рамках подготовки к грядущей гонке Суперкортемаджоре. По какой-то непонятной причине Аскари потерял управление и вылетел с трассы; смерть была мгновенной. Итальянская нация оплакивала потерю их лучшего гонщика, а Фанхио сказал: Я потерял своего величайшего соперника. Несомненно, это было правдой, однако при более детальном рассмотрении мы обнаруживаем, что в действительности они крайне редко имели возможность бороться друг с другом в гонках, выступая на одинаковых машинах.";

He then raced the F2 car during the 1955 season, the undoubted highlight of which was an aggregate win in the Circuit du Lac at Aix-les-Bains. 
Accepting an invitation to join the Gordini team for 1954, Bayol made a fine debut, taking fifth place in the Argentine GP, and followed this with fourth at Pau and fifth at Bordeaux, where he blotted his copybook by ignoring repeated signals to pit and hand his car over to team leader Jean Behra. Gordini sacked him, but he was later forgiven and rejoined the team for 1955, only for his season to be curtailed after he sustained serious head injuries when he crashed the latest 3-litre Gordini in practice at Le Mans.

In 1950, he raced the Veritas-Meteor in Formula 2, winning races at Grenzlandring and Solitude, and the Eifelrennen at the Nurburgring, which led to an invitation to help develop the pre-war Mercedes, which raced again at the start of 1951 in South America, taking second place in the Eva Peron Cup.

Вместе с Ролтом он вывел ERA и на старт Гран При Великобритании в 1950 г., но машина вскоре сошла. Год спустя ему все-таки удалось добраться до финиша – он привел считавшейся до той поры ненадежный BRM на седьмое место, несмотря на несколько экстремальные обстоятельства, вызванные тем, что выхлопная труба раскалилась докрасна. 
В 1951 г. команда Jaguar подписала с ним контракт на выступление в гонках спортивных автомобилей, и вместе со своим старым приятелем Питером Уайтхедом он праздновал триумф, одержав победы в Ле-Мане и заняв второе место в Tourist Trophy в Дандроде. В Ле-Мане в 1953 г. Уокер финишировал вторым, на этот раз вместе с Моссом. Перейдя в Aston Martin, в 1955 г. Питер выиграл 9-часовую гонку в Гудвуде вместе с Деннисом Пуром, а также дважды выступил в гонках одноместных автомобилей - в Зандфорте (за команду Мосса) и Эйнтри (за команду Роба Уокера).  В 1956 г. в Ле-Мане Уокер попал в опасную аварию, отделавшись, по счастью, сравнительно легко, после чего принял решение уйти из гонок; правда, впоследствии он все-таки вышел один раз на старт – за рулем Connaught Роба Уокера на Гран При в Сиракузах в 1957 г.";

In trials he won successive RAC championships, and his special was much copied by his competitors, while in rallies he campaigned a Ford Pilot, winning the Tulip Rally on three occasions. 
In 1950 Wharton won at Zandvoort with a Cooper-JAP, while in 1951 he went hill-climbing, winning the first of four successive championships. Meanwhile he had taken up circuit racing in a big way, initially competing in Grands Prix with a large and old-fashioned Frazer-Nash. It ran reliably on its debut at Bremgarten in 1952, and Wharton took it to fourth place, his best-ever World Championship finish. This car was replaced by a more competitive Cooper-Bristol by the end of the season, but he could gain no major success with it the following season. He was kept busy by BRM, who were still racing their V16 car in Libre events, and joined the Owen team for 1954 to handle their Maserati 250F in Grands Prix and their V16 in Libre races, winning the Glover Trophy. 
As if he wasnt already sufficiently stretched by his commitments, Wharton also tried his hand at sports car racing with the works Jaguar, winning the 1954 Reims 12 Hours with Peter Whitehead. For 1955, Ken joined the Vanwall team, suffering a nasty accident in the International Trophy at Silverstone which resulted in burns to his arms and neck. It was generally an unproductive year, and Wharton freelanced in 1956, taking a third place in the Australian Tourist Trophy in Melbourne with a Ferrari Monza.

После окончания военных действий он вернулся в гонки, выступая на Alfa Romeo, Delage и Nash-Healey. В 1950 г. за рулем ERA Питера Уолкера он принял участие в Гран При Великобритании, но в основном ограничивался национальными соревнованиями, выступая в 1951 г. на Delage Роба Уолкера и заняв в 1952 г. второе место в International Trophy вслед за своим напарником Лэнсом Маклином (это был единственный раз, когда он вышел на старт за HWM). 
С 1953 по 1955 гг. Ролт долбился значительных успехов в национальных гонках на темно-синем Connaught Уолкера, одержал множество побед в Формуле 2, а также вместе с дружелюбным Данканом Хамильтоном выступал в гонках спортивных автомобилей за заводскую команду Jaguar. Этот непревзойденный дуэт в 1953 г. одержал победу в 24-часовой гонке в Ле-Мане, а спустя еще год праздновал победу и в Ле-Мане, и в 12-часовой гонке в Реймсе.";

By 1955 Marr had taken delivery of a B-Type model, but after the British GP he raced it little until early 1956, when he drove splendidly to finish fourth in the New Zealand GP, after starting from the back of the grid without benefit of practice, and then took third place in the Lady Wigram Trophy at Christchurch.";

Born into a wealthy family, and with a motoring background courtesy of his step-father, Fitch served as a fighter pilot during World War II, and was held as a ROW after being shot down. In poor physical condition upon his release, he did not turn to motor racing until 1949, but was soon a major name in SCCA circles. In March 1951, on his first racing trip overseas, he won the Peron Grand Prix, a sports car race in Buenos Aires, driving an Allard-Cadillac. This victory brought him to the attention of millionaire racer and entrant Briggs Cunningham, who took him into his sports car team, which was attempting to win Le Mans and other long-distance events. John won the Sebring 12 Hours, and finished third in the Cunningham at Le Mans in 1953, a season which also saw him dip his toe into single-seater racing with HWM in the Italian GP and finish fourth at Aix-les-Bains in a Cooper-Bristol, attempt to qualify for Indianapolis, and take part in the Monte Carlo and Alpine Rallies... 
Having impressed Neubauer during a test in a 300SL Mercedes in 1952, Fitch finally got the call from the great man and found himself in the factory sports car team for 1955, and reserve driver (not used) at a couple of Grands Prix. Unfortunately this was the year of the Le Mans disaster, and Fitchs co-driver Levegh was a central figure in the tragedy. John did, however, have the satisfaction of sharing the winning Mercedes with Moss at Dundrod later in the year before the Stuttgart team withdrew from racing. 
Fitch then returned to the States, initially to help Chevrolets sports car effort, which limited his racing somewhat, but nothing was allowed to get in the way of his annual pilgrimage to Sebring which lasted until 1964 - by which time he was fully involved in the management of the Lime Rock circuit, which was used for both racing and the testing of road cars.";

In 1953 Lucas joined Gordini as team manager and occasional driver, though he was still to be seen racing his own Ferrari under the Los Amigos banner in North African events such as those held at Agadir and Marrakesh which were popular at the time. It was only when urgent business matters called Manzon away from the Monza circuit that Lucas stood in to make his solitary World Championship appearance. 
In 1956 he took an old Ferrari 625 to fifth place in the Caen GP, and in 1957 he finished second in the F2 Coupe de Vitesse at Reims in Alan Browns Cooper. He also took third place in his Los Amigos Jaguar D-Type at Le Mans that year, but driving du Puys Maserati 250F in the end-of-season Moroccan GP he overturned the car and was badly injured. 
Realising that he would not be able to race again to his fullest abilities, he threw himself into administrative roles within the sport as well as co-founding the magazine Sport-Auto with Gerard Crombac in 1962, moving on to other publishing projects when his interest in motor sport had waned.";

В середине тридцатых годов он проживал в Лондоне под опекой своего кузена Принца Чула; после того как Бира попробовал свои силы в управлении Riley Imp и MG Magnette, Чула подарил ему на двадцать первый день рождения новенький ERA. Основав свою собственную конюшню с поэтическим названием White Mouse Stable (Конюшня Белая Мышь), Бира выиграл множество гонок на трех ERA непосредственно перед началом войны, став одним из самых известных представителей заводских марок. Он также управлял Maserati Уитни Стрейта, и - менее успешно - Delage Симена, и его выдающиеся выступления были вознаграждены победами в BRDC Road Racing Gold Star в 1936, 1937 и 1938.  
После войны Бира вновь сел за руль своей ERA, но позже пересел на Maserati, и в 1947 одержал победу в Гран При де Фронтир в Шимэ. Он должен был продолжать участвовать в гонках вместе со своим кузеном Чулой до конца 1948, и в то же время рискнул выступить в Формуле 2 за Simca Gordini - и выиграл гонку в Скарпнаке в Швеции.  
Сезон 1949 получился насыщенным - Бира со своим Maserati San Remo пришел в конюшню Enrico Plate и дважды финишировал пятым в Буэнос-Айресе и вторым вслед за Фанхио в Мар-дель-Плата. Затем он вернулся в Европу и провел серию прекрасных выступлений, принесших ему вторые места на Гран При Альби, Франции, Сан-Ремо и Рузильон, и третьи - в Италии и Зандфорте. 
В 1950 году стартовал чемпионат мира, и Бире удалось занять четвертое место в Бремгартене - машины были  действительно выше всяких похвал. В следующем году он поставил на Maserati 12-цилиндровый мотор OSCA V12 и выиграл всего лишь одну гонку - пятикруговой Libre Richmond Trophy в Гудвуде. Он продолжил ездить на OSCA и в гонках Формулы 1 в 1952, а также управлял хоть и быстрым, но ненадежным заводским Gordini. Для маленького принца наступило время разочарований, и казалось, что он совсем потерял интерес к гонкам после столь длинной полосы неудач. Тем не менее, в 1953 он время от времени возвращался на трассу в составе команды Connaught, а в конце года обзавелся собственным Maserati A6GCM. В начале 1954 он приобрел Maserati 250F, и желание участвовать в гонках разгорелось в нем с новой силой. Выступив в соревнованиях, не входивших в зачет чемпионата, он был первым в Шимэ, финишировал вторым в Руане и Пескаре и на Гран При Франции в Реймсе он занял лучшее для себя место в чемпионате. В начале 1955 он одержал свою последнюю победу на новозеландском Гран При в Ардморе, затем вернулся в Европу и занял второе место на Гран При Бордо. Его последней гонкой стала International Trophy, где он занял третье место, после чего он принял неожиданное решение уйти в отставку.";

He returned for a full season in 1953, making an immediate impression with third place in the Belgian GP, and second in the non-championship Modena GP. In 1954, with Fangio having been lured to Mercedes, and Gonzalez to Ferrari, Onofre found himself as effective Maserati team leader and he did well in the early-season races, winning the Rome GP at Castel Fusano and finishing third at Pau.

Владелец свинофермы из Дербишира, он начал выступать в 1935 г. на MG Magnette, а в предвоенные годы добился кое-каких успехов за рулем 4,7-литровой Bugatti. Война помешала ему взлететь на пик своей карьеры, но даже в те годы он не терял времени даром, приобретая множество списанных гоночных машинах – готовился к мирным временам.  
Имея в распоряжении Maserati и E-Type ERA, выкупленные у Питера Уайтхеда, он вскоре с энтузиазмом принялся участвовать в континентальных гонках, получая от этого несказанное удовольствие; наибольшего успеха он добился именно на Maserati 4CLT/48, особенно в Гудвуде, где он, казалось, вполне мог стать и победителем.  
Редж пользовался таким уважением, что Alfa Romeo пригласила его в свою заводскую команду, и в самой первой гонке чемпионата мира в 1950 г., проводившейся в Силверстоуне, он блестяще финишировал на третьем месте. 
В 1951 г. он привел Ferrari “Thinwall Special” Тони Вандерволла к двум очковым финишам в Гран При и одержал победу в International Trophy в Силверстоуне, где гонка была остановлена из-за сильнейшего дождя. Куда менее удачным оказалось его сотрудничество с BRM и их проблемной машиной с двигателем V16, сводившей на нет все попытки Реджа добиться каких-либо результатов.  
За рулем Ferrari T500 – из-за изменений в регламенте эта машина больше не могла принимать участие в гонках формулы – он выступал в национальных соревнованиях, и в сезоне 1954 г. записал на свой счет множество успешных выступлений. Позднее он время от времени выступал на Connaught Роба Уолкера, а за рулем Ferrari Super Squalo выиграл в 1957 г. Гран При Новой Зеландии и гонку South Island в Дунедине, после чего сменил род деятельности, взяв на себя обязанности тим-менеджера в Aston Martin и став ключевой фигурой команды с начала пятидесятых. 
После ухода из гонок Дэвида Брауна Редж оказался более чем востребован и в течение 1961 и 1962 гг. контролировал команды Yeoman Credit и Bowmaker Lola, после чего решил основать свое собственное детище – Reg Parnell Racing; все только начиналось, когда Парнелл, абсолютно здоровый, в январе 1964 г. внезапно скончался от перитонита, явившегося следствием обычной операции по удалению аппендицита – ему было всего лишь 52.";

Он начал выступать в 1934 г. за рулем ERA, и достаточно скоро его имя стало известным. В 1938 г. он привез свой автомобиль в Австралию и стал победителем Гран При на трассе Батраст.  
После войны он вновь вывел свою верную ERA на старт и в 1947 г.  занял второе место в British Empire Trophy на острове Мэн. Годом спустя он получил серьезные травмы – правда, не в гонке, а в авиакатастрофе на аэродроме Кройдон, во время подготовки к рейсу в Милан, где он собирался приобрести Ferrari 125. Правда, прошло некоторое время, прежде чем он смог добиться от темно-зеленой машины конкурентоспособной скорости – произошло это в 1949 г. Он вплотную приблизился к победе на Гран При Франции в Реймсе, но проблемы с коробкой передач отбросили его на третье место; зато в Чехословакии он праздновал триумф, став первым британцем со времен Симена, выигравшим важную гонку за границей. В сезоне 1950 г. он продолжил успешно выступать на Ferrari, выиграв гонки Jersey Road Race и Ulster Trophy. Несмотря на свой статус любителя, Питер вовсе не походил на лентяя-неумеху и в 1951 г. несколько раз блестяще финишировал за рулем Ferrari, но самым важным событием того года стала, несомненно, его выдающаяся победа в Ле-Мане, одержанная вместе с Питером Уокером за Jaguar.  
В сезонах 1952 и 1953 гг. Уайтхед, помимо Ferrari, пилотировал Alta и Cooper-Alta, но все больше и больше увлекался гонками спортивных автомобилей, где имел значительно больше шансов на успех. В 1953 г. на D-Type Jaguar он одержал победу в 12 часов Реймса вместе с Моссом и в 12 часов Эре вместе с Томом Кодом. Годом спустя он вновь стал победителем в Реймсе, выступив на заводском Jaguar вместе с Кеном Уортоном, и, приняв участие в последнем для себя Гран При Великобритании, он предпочел сосредоточиться на своем новоприобретенном спортивном Cooper-Jaguar и гонках серии Libre, в которых он участвовал на 3-литровой Ferrari – в основном в другом полушарии, где он частенько выступал, пока в Англии царила зима.

After driving a BMW 2002 in national hill-climbs, he graduated to the works European touring car championship team, winning the Nurburgring 24-hour race in 1969. Stuck then took over from Jochen Mass in the Ford Germany Capri in the national series for 1972, and won the Spa 24 Hours with Mass as co-driver.
His single-seater career began properly in 1973 when he raced the works March in Formula 2, graduating to the Grand Prix team the following year, but he proved to be somewhat inconsistent, very quick on some occasions, but mysteriously lacklustre on others. He did well in F2, however, finishing second in the championship with four wins (at Barcelona, Hockenheim, Rouen and Enna).
Initially dropped from the March Grand Prix team for 1975, Stuck made a successful sortie into IMSA with BMW, but was then recalled to the Bicester ranks to replace the out-of-favour Lella Lombardi. He remained with the team in 1976, but it was the same infuriating mixture of the brilliant and the banal once more. At Watkins Glen Hans finished fifth, after being 23rd on the first lap, and occasional Formula 2 outings with the 762 produced three wins in only five starts.
Given the chance to race the Brabham-Alfa in 1977 following the death of Carlos Pace in an air crash, Hans scored superb third places in Germany and Austria, and led the US GP at Watkins Glen before blotting his copybook by sliding off the circuit. From then on it was downhill all the way as far as Formula 1 was concerned, a season with Shadow bringing only one points finish, and an even more dispiriting year with ATS yielding the same return.
Hans then turned his back on F1, but certainly not on motor sport, for he was soon immersed in a huge schedule of sports, GT and touring car racing. He joined the Rothmans Porsche team in 1985, sharing the drivers' crown with Derek Bell in both 1985 and 1986, and won Le Mans with Bell and Holbert in 1986 and '87. After a switch to Audi, his presence spiced up IMSA's GTO class in 1989, and back at home he won the 1990 DTM championship in the awesome 3.6-litre V8 quattro.
As the nineties unfolded Stuck was still racing competitively in German Super Touring for Audi and was a Le Mans regular. In 1994 he finished third with Sullivan and Boutsen in a Dauer Porsche 962LM, and the following year he was placed sixth, this time in a Kremer Porsche with Boutsen and Bouchut. Just as his career seemed to be winding down came the surprise news that he was forsaking Audi to join Opel's squad to contest the Class 11TC series in 1996. Driving the Team Rosberg car, he could still show the youngsters a thing or two, winning both rounds in Helsinki. He was also part of the factory Porsche team, taking second at Le Mans with Boutsen and Wollek in the 911 GTI In 1997 Hans teamed up with Boutsen to contest the FIA GT championship in one of the works cars but, despite a number of top-six placings, the experienced duo were deemed too old, and dropped at season's end.

В 1929 г. он повторил свой успех в Реймсе, одержал победы в Антибе, Комменже и Ля Боле, и продолжил череду победных финишей в 1930 г., выиграв Гран При в По и Алжире.  
В 1931 г. Этанкелен решил обзавестись Alfa Romeo, и на ней он достаточно успешно выступал до тех пор, пока в 1934 г. не произошли изменения в технических требованиях, вследствие чего он был вынужден пересесть на Maserati. На этой машине в течение нескольких последующих сезонов он частенько финишировал на втором или третьем месте, по-настоящему серьезные успехи почему-то избегали его, хотя в 1936 г. ему удалось стать победителем в По, а в 1934 г. он вместе с Чинетти выиграл гонку в Ле-Мане. 
После войны Этанкелен вывел Alfa Romeo на старт первой гонки в Париже, но только в 1948 г., после приобретения Lago-Talbot, он смог появляться в соревнованиях регулярно. В 1949 г. Фи Фи наконец удалось достичь желаемых результатов, он победил на Гран При Парижа, а в Марселе, Монце и Брно занимал вторые места. В 1950 г. – первом в истории сезоне чемпионата мира – Этанкелену удалось пару раз финишировать на пятом месте; на стареньком Talbot он ездил на протяжении всего сезона 1951 г., и даже на следующий год автомобиль оказался вполне пригодным для выступлений и выходил на старт нескольких гонок Ф1 и серии Libre.  
К 1953 г. этот упорный гонщик, заняв вместе с Левегом третье место в 3 часах Касабланки, практически перестал выходить на трассу, но в том году Гран При Руана не входил в зачет чемпионата мира, и, чтобы стартовое поле не пустовало, организаторы заодно пригласили автомобили Формулы 1. Фи Фи, будучи родом из тех мест, не смог устоять перед соблазном вывести свой верный Talbot на старт и составить конкуренцию заводским Ferrari.

В той гонке он лидировал, но был вынужден уступить Широну и финишировать на втором месте.

За рулем специального купе с короткой рамой Alfa Romeo он принимал участие в классических дорожных гонках в конце сороковых годов. В 1948 г. он лидировал на Giro de Sicilia, пока не сошел; в следующем сезоне он был значительно удачливее – занял второе место в своем классе. В том же году Франко блестяще выступил в Милле Милья и финишировал третьим. 
В 1950 г.он вместе с Широном в составе Plate вывел на старт Maserati - видавшие, надо сказать, и лучшие дни, и тем не менее он умудрился занять пятое место в Гран При Сан-Марино в Оспедалетти. В следующий раз Ролу довелось сесть за руль одноместного автомобиля в конце сезона 1951 г., в Монце, где он выступил на новенькой OSCA. Машина безнадежно отстала от конкурентов, но отважный Франко вновь вывел ее на старт Гран При Валентине в начале 1952 г., где она и замерла из-за прогоревшей прокладки головки цилиндра.  
В 1952 г. Франко был включен в состав заводской команды Maserati для выступления на Гран При Италии, но его машина сошла на 24 круге. В 1953 г. авария на Tour of Sicily положила конец его гоночной карьере.";

В 1946 г. он выиграл предварительный заезд и затем стал третьим на Гран При Милана, а в 1947 г. был вторым в Бари, уступив Варци, и третьим на Гран При Италии, проводившемся в Семпионе-Парк, где он завоевал поул-позицию. 
Годом спустя Консальво занял второе место на Гран При Франции, а на Гран При в Монце, показав лучшее время на круге – третье. В 1949 г. Alfa Corse не принимала участия в гонках Формулы 1, но в соревнованиях кузовных автомобилей Милле Милья Санези на Alfa смог финишировать вторым; в 1950 г. команда вернулась, в Гран При он принял участие лишь один раз, но выиграл гонку спортивных автомобилей Coppa Inter Europa в Монце. 
Самым активным сезоном в гонках Больших призов для Консальво стал 1951 год – выйдя на старт четырех Гран При, он дважды финишировал в очках, но, после того как Alfa в конце года покинула арену Гран При, он полностью переключился на соревнования спортивных автомобилей и в 1954 г. стал победителем в своем классе в Carrera Panamericana. В том же году во время тестов он, управляя Disco Volante, попал в аварию, получил серьезные травмы, однако уже в 1955 г. вернулся на трассу и занял второе место в гонке по подъему на холм Vermenico на 1,9-литровой Alfa.";

 В 1949 г.

После того, как команда Валли приказала долго жить, он приобрел машину для выступлений в Ле-Мане и Talbot T26C, подготовленный Жиро-Кабанту, но на старт Гран При в 1951 г. его вывел всего лишь пару раз – чаще не позволяли дела. 
На старте сезона 1952 г. Мэресс продал свои автомобили, но продолжал периодически появляться в гонках на автомобилях, предоставленных ему кем-нибудь другим; он погиб в 1954 г., во время практики перед Coupe de Paris в Монлери – пытаясь избежать столкновения с более медленной машиной, он увернулся и врезался в бетонную стену.";

В 1946 г. он выступал на Maserati 4CL, вместе с Соммером одержал победу в Лилле и занял вторые места в Форе, Перпиньяне и Альби. Год спустя он финишировал вторым в Лионе и третьем в По вместе с ‘Maser’, а также успешно выступал на свежеприобретенном Delage, за рулем которого завоевал еще одно второе место в Перпиньяне, третье в Марселе, пятое в Jersey Road Race и шестое на Гран При Италии. 
Delage исправно служил Анри на протяжении последующих трех сезонов, принес ему вторые места в Монлери и Шимэ в 1948 г., третье в Пескаре в 1949 г. и четвертое в Руане в 1950 г. Но самую волнующую гонку на этой машине он провел в 1949 г. – 24 часа Ле-Мана, где Анри шел вторым, последние пару часов ведя Delage на той же скорости, что и в гонках Гран При, и уступил только Чинетти.  
После выступления в Гран При Италии на Talbot Розье в 1949 г. Анри планировал регулярно выходить на старт за рулем этой же машины в 1951 г., начинавшемся с серии незачетных гонок. В Сиракузах он занял четвертое место, в По попал в аварию – машина перевернулась, но сам гонщик не пострадал, в Сан-Ремо финишировал восьмым, в Бордо – шестым, в дождевом International Trophy – одиннадцатым и на Гран При Парижа в Монлери – четвертым. Неделей позже должна была проходить входившая в зачет чемпионата гонка на зловещей дорожной трассе Бремгартен в Берне. Из-за дождя покрытие трассы было еще более ненадежным, чем обычно, Talbot Анри вылетел с трассы, пробил ограждение и перевернулся, повторив аварию в По.

Еще до начала войны его мысли были заняты только 24-часовой гонкой в Ле-Мане, и он терпеливо ждал возможности принять участие в этом классическом соревновании; шанс исполнить свое заветное желание представился ему в 1938 г., и он выступил за команду Talbot в качестве вспомогательного гонщика. После войны он выступал на Delage, занял второе место в По в 1947 г., в 1949 г. приобрел Talbot, за рулем которого выходил на старт Гран При в 1950 и 1951 гг.  
В 1951 г. в Ле-Мане на заводском Talbot он финишировал четвертым, но остался недоволен машиной и принял решение на следующий год выйти на старт на собственном автомобиле, все расходы по подготовке которого он нес самолично. И все затраты практически оправдались – он в одиночку вел машину на протяжении более 22 часов и был несомненным лидером, когда у него отказал переключатель скоростей и полетел двигатель. 
Казалось, его мечта так и останется несбыточной, но в 1955 г. Нойбауэр, помня о подвигах Пьера, предложил тому место за рулем заводского Mercedes. Как будто предчувствуя беду, Левег озвучил свое беспокойство, находясь на прямой перед боксами, и его опасения оправдались: на том же самом месте он оказался вовлечен в гоночный инцидент, в результате которого его машина буквально взмыла в воздух и рухнула прямо на переполненные трибуны; авария повлекла за собой гибель 80 человек, в том числе и самого француза, и вошла в историю автоспорта как самая кровавая трагедия в мире гонок.";

Вскоре после войны Шабу вернулся в гонки в составе команды Пола Валли Ecurie France, приняв на себя должность спортивного директора и первого гонщика на своей Delahaye 135S. В 1947 г. команда приобрела одноместный Talbot 1939 г., на котором Эжен выиграл гонки в Марселе и Перпиньяне. Затем место пилота было передано Луи Широну, что вызвало сильное раздражение Шабу и Шарля Поцци, которые решили уйти и основать собственную команду. Эжен стал чемпионом Франции, в 1948 г. они создали Ecurie Leutitia, и Шабу продолжал выступать на своей Delahaye. В 1949 г. на Гран При Франции он занял шестое место, а в Ле-Мане потерпел неудачу - он лидировал на протяжении девяти миль, когда его машину внезапно охватил огонь, и в конце концов он вынужден был прекратить гонку.  
В 1950 г. Шабу наконец выпал шанс сесть за руль более конкурентоспособного автомобиля, чем его Delahaye - он получил приглашение занять место гонщика за рулем Lago-Talbot взамен травмированного Мартена. Вместе с Этанкеленом он занял пятое место на Гран При Франции. 
В 1952 г. в 24 часах Ле-Мана Шабу шел шестым, и когда до конца гонки оставалось всего два часа, он разбил свой Talbot. В ожидании того, когда его извлекут из-под перевернутой машины, у него было достаточно времени, чтобы хорошенько подумать и принять решение - с него хватит!";

Его карьера началась в 1926 г., но настоящей славы он добился, придя в 1930 г. в Maserati. В течение трех последующих сезонов на его долю выпадали время от времени победы, но, по большому счету, удача обходила его стороной – до тех пор, пока он не перешел в команду Alfa Romeo Энцо Феррари во второй половине сезона 1933 г. Вскоре он стал победителем Гран При Пескары, Комменжа, Марселя и Италии, и подобные успехи были вознаграждены приглашением в Mersedes-Benz в качестве второго гонщика в 1934 г.     
В своей первой же гонке, Эйфельреннен, раздраженный приказаниями держаться позади напарника фон Браухича, Фаджиоли продемонстрировал свое недовольство следующим образом – остановил машину посреди трассы и вернулся в боксы пешком. Это был не последний случай, когда у него вспыхивали конфликты с командой, однако подобные инциденты не помешали ему одержать победы в Гран При Италии и Испании в том сезоне, и в Монако, на АФУС и в Барселоне – в следующем. Он оставался в команде вплоть до 1936 г., а затем перешел к самым заклятым их соперникам – в Auto Union, в Триполи финишировал пятым, но вынужден был пропустить большую часть сезона из-за болезни.  
По сути, Фаджиоли вернулся на арену Больших призов в 1950 г., вместе с непобедимой Alfa Romeo. Его опыт очень ему пригодился, и после нескольких расчетливых выступлений он занял третью строчку в чемпионате мира. Он остался в команде и на 1951 год, но во время Гран При Франции после разворота в начале гонки он заехал на пит-стоп и вынужден был отдать свою машину Фанхио, чтобы тот закончил на ней гонку, в которой аргентинец в итоге стал победителем. Это стало последней соломинкой для гордого Фаджиоли, и он никогда больше не выходил на старт в гонках Гран При. 
За рулем собственной OSCA он одержал победу в своем классе в гонке Милле Милья, а в 1952 г. повторил это достижение, на этот раз на кузовной Lancia Aurelia. Куда более примечателен тот факт, что он был третьим в общем зачете, опередив многих более опытных спортивных гонщиков. В том году в Гран При Монако принимали участие только кузовные автомобили; во время тренировочного заезда Фаджиоли потерял управление в туннеле и врезался в бетонную балюстраду. Его выбросило из автомобиля, и в госпиталь он был доставлен в бессознательном состоянии, с переломами руки и ноги. Четыре дня спустя он пришел в сознание, казалось, опасность миновала, но по прошествии трех недель после аварии у него случился рецидив -  полностью отказала нервная система, и в возрасте всего лишь 54 лет он скончался.";

So it was 1946 before Aldo went to work as a mechanic as Gordini reconstructed his team. The youngster had the urge to race, and was allowed occasional outings, taking class honours in the Coupe du Salon at Montlhery in both 1948 and 1949. 
In 1950 he drove the Type 11 car in selected Formula 2 races, taking second place at Cadours and fifth at Aix-les-Bains, and sharing fifth with Trintignant at Roubaix.

В Гудвуде на ERA Брайан смог занять несколько неплохих мест (он дважды был вторым - в Richmond Trophy и Chichester Cup), после чего ему разрешили принять участие в Гран При Великобритании, на котором он занял лучшее место среди частников - седьмое. В Ле-Мане, выступая на Aston Martin вместе с Абекассисом, он пришел к финишу пятым, после чего авария в Гудвуде во время Daily Graphic Trophy, когда его ERA перевернулась и в нее врезался автомобиль Бранка, поставила крест на всей его дальнейшей карьере.

Что интересно, самых значительных успехов он добивался за рулем машин конкурирующих фирм. В 1948 г. он выиграл 24-часовую гонку спортивных автомобилей в Спа на Aston Martin, выступив вместе с Джоном Хорсфолом, а спустя год там же, в Спа, занял второе место – и снова на Aston, на этот раз вместе с Брэкенбери. В 1950 г., уже на Jaguar XK120, Джонсон финишировал третьим в Tourist Trophy и пятым в Милле Милья, а год спустя, опять на Jaguar, вместе с Тони Ролтом занял четвертое место. В 1952 г., управляя Nash-Healey, Лесли вместе с Томми Уиздомом пришел к финишу третьим, и в том же году на той же машине занял четвертое место в своем классе в  Милле Милья (несмотря на проблемы с амортизатором).

Впервые он заявил о себе в 1932 г., когда в Ле-Мане наголову разбил заводские Alfa, проведя за рулем 21 час. Годом спустя он вновь одержал там победу, на этот раз с легендарным Нуволари. Вскоре Рэймонд начал выступать и в гонках Гран При, как правило, в качестве независимого участника соревнований, так как не мог выдержать давления, оказываемого руководством команд. Поэтому ему всегда приходилось выжимать из машины все, на что та была способна, и ехать на пределе своих возможностей, испытывая ни с чем не сравнимое наслаждение, когда ему удавалось обойти такую мощную команду, как Scuderia Ferrari или Mercedes. В таком свете его успехи выглядят очень значительными; выйти на старт Гран При в одноместном гоночном автомобиле до начала войны ему так и не удалось, зато вместе с Вимиллем он стал победителем Гран При Франции спортивных автомобилей в 1936 г.  
Вскоре после войны Соммер вернулся на трассу, а в 1946 г. провел свой лучший сезон, по ходу которого ему удалось одержать знаменитую победу на Гран При Сен-Клод, в то время как заводские Alfa 158 сошли. 1947 г. он пропустил, глотнув по ошибке метанола на Гран При По, но годом спустя вернулся за рулем полузаводской Ferrari и выиграл гонку Ф2 в Реймсе. В 1949 г. Соммер обзавелся большим Talbot и напоминал кота среди голубиной стаи, сходу врываясь в толпу итальянцев, которые взирали на его экстремальный стиль с некоторым беспокойством. 
В 1950 г. он выступал лучше, чем когда-либо и занял четвертое место в Монако за рулем своей шустрой Ferrari (на которой он выиграл гонки Формулы 2 в Рубэ, Экс-ле-Бэн и Бремгартене). На следующем Гран При чемпионата он вывел на старт свой Talbot, но, несмотря на всю его мощь, очков заработать не удалось. Известие о его гибели потрясло весь автоспортивный мир – страшная весть пришла из Кадура, где он принимал участие в одной из второстепенных гонок сезона в 500-кубовом классе, во время которой, как считается, у его Cooper заклинило колесный подшипник.";

Помимо этого, он был и одаренным гонщиком на автомобилях, что и доказал своими победами в По в 1947 и 1948 гг. за рулем Maserati, хотя его выступления на четырех колесах можно пересчитать по пальцам.

В 1950 г. в составе Ferrari Серафини вышел на старт своего единственного Гран При, где вместе с Аскари занял второе место; помимо этого, он еще несколько раз финишировал вторым в других соревнованиях – стоит отметить гонку в Педральбес за рулем автомобиля Ф1, а также гонки Eva Peron Cup в Буэнос-Айресе и Curcuit of Garda, проведенные на T166 Ф2. 
В 1951 г. он вновь занял несколько вторых мест – на Гран При в Сиракузах и Сан-Ремо, а затем попал в еще одну серьезную аварию, на этот раз в Милле Милья, и получил переломы руки и ноги. После этого Дорино очень редко появлялся на трассе, но в 1954 г. вернулся на старт, приняв участие в гонке Брешиа-Рим-Брешиа, в которой он на Lancia занял седьмое место в общем зачете и первое в классе GT.";

После успеха в Talbot он в 1931 г. перешел в заводскую команду Maserati и финишировал третьим на Гран При Рима и Франции.  
Слава пришла к нему вместе с Alfa Romeo. Бьондетти мужественно держался прямо на хвосте у трио Mersedes на Гран При Триполи, в то время как остальной пелетон сдался и уступил, но у него сгорел двигатель. Сезон 1938 принес ему первую победу - в Милле Милья, и он был на вершине успеха, когда разразилась война. Когда гонки возобновились, Бьондетти было уже 49, но он добился хет-трика побед в своей любимой Милле Милья (1947-1949) и дважды побеждал в Tour of Sicily - в 1948 и 1949. Его победа в дождевой гонке в 1947 г. была просто блестящей. Без двух передач и с проблемами в топливной системе на его Alfa Romeo, ветеран-итальянец смог отбросить легендарного Нуволари на второе место. Избегая чистокровных спортивных Ferrari, на которых он смог добиться успехов, Бьодетти сконструировал гибрид Ferrari-Jaguar, который подвел его на Гран При Италии в 1950 и продолжал разочаровывать впоследствии.  
Неудивительно, что он вернулся к проверенным гарцующим жеребцам и вместе со Станьоли выступал в 1952 г. на спортивных автомоблиях, заняв третье место на Гран При Монако. В том же году он финишировал вторым в Кубке Ачебро, 12-часовой гонке в Пескаре. В 1953 пересел на конкурирующую Lancia, но вернулся в родную конюшню в 1954 - провести свой последний сезон в гонках. В своем финальном выступлении в Милле Милья он пришел четвертым.

Окончание регулярной картинговой карьеры происходит через год, когда Вернь занимает седьмое место на чемпионате мира в классе Формула-А.
После этого француз периодически участвует в различных картинговых турнирах; в 2011 году он выигрывает парижскую гонку звёзд ERDF Masters Kart в парижском ДС ""Берси"", опередив на трассе Себастьяна Лёба, Адриана Сутила и Стефана Сарразана.

В 2007 году Жан-Эрик приходит в национальную Ф-Рено Campus, где быстро привыкает к технике и приехав 10 раз на подиум в 13 гонках (при шести победах) с солидным отрывом выигрывает чемпионский титул. Эти успехи Верня позволяют ему стать членом молодёжных программ FFSA и Red Bull.[1]
Через год француз переходит в более старший класс, стартуя в нескольких первенствах двухлитровой Ф-Рено. За два года в Западноевропейском и Европейском кубках он проводит более полусотни гонок, выиграв семь из них. Наиболее удачны были заезды второго сезона, когда были одержаны все семь побед и добыты два вторых места в общем зачёте (оба раза Жан-Эрик уступил испанцу Альберту Косте).
В 2010 году Вернь переходит в Британскую Ф3, где в сезон дебюта, с большим отрывом, выигрывает чемпионский титул. В 30 гонках француз 11 раз стартует с поула и одерживает 13 побед. Ближайший соперник проигрывает Жану-Эрику 99 баллов. Вернь также стартует в F3 Masters и Гран-при Макао.
Параллельно с Ф3 Вернь стартует в GP3 и Ф-Рено 3.5. а также проводит тесты во второй команде Red Bull a Ф1.

В серии француз дебютирует в начале сентября 2010 года, когда на седьмом этапе сезона сменяет в команде Tech 1 Racing новозеландца Брендона Хартли. Жан-Эрик быстро привыкает к технике и уже в своей третьей гонке одерживает победу. Четыре из шести гонок своего мини-сезона он завершает на подиуме.
В 2011 году менеджмент переводит Верня в команду Carlin Motorsport.
Француз проводит весьма стабильный сезон позволив себе лишь четырежды в семнадцати гонках сезона не финишировать в очковой зоне. По ходу сезона было одержано пять побед, позволивших Жану-Эрику до последнего этапа бороться за титул с канадцем Робертом Викенсом, однако проигрыш сопернику в первой гонке последнего этапа и сход во втором заезде не позволил французу завоевать первое место в общем зачёте. Вернь в итоге отстал от Викенса лишь на 9 очков.

После тех первых тестов француза ни раз привлекают для тестовой и промо работы в оба, принадлежащих Red Bull, коллективах Ф1. Осенью 2011 года, после весьма успешных тестов на Яс Марине,[2] руководство автоспортивной программы австрийского концерна подписывает с французом контракт боевого пилота своей второй команды -Scuderia Toro Rosso.[3]";
797;"Charles Pic";10;15.2.1990;"Монтелимар, Нион, Дром, Рона-Альпы, Франция";;;;"Шарль Пик";;;"Биография
Родился в семье известного танцовщика, который и стал самым первым педагогом собственному сыну; семья постоянно разъезжала по гастролям, и маленький Шарль привык к постоянным сменам жилья[3].
С 1761 по 1764 годы обучался в Штутгарте у выдающегося балетного танцора и хореографа, новатора и теоретика балетного искусства Ж.-Ж.Новерра. Эти уроки сыграли огромную роль в творчестве Ле Пика - он стал пропагандистом реформ своего учителя. Будучи танцовщиком деми-характерного плана, под воздействием Новерра Ле Пик постепенно сменил несколько вычурную манеру, типичную для стиля рококо, на более естественную и живую[1], особенно это касалось игры в мимических сценах, которым Новерр придавал огромное значение[4]. В течение нескольких лет он работал в разных европейских балетных труппах: в Варшаве - 1765 (Русская энциклопедия балета называет 1764 год[1]), Вене (1765[1]), в Венеции - 1769, Милане - 1773 и Неаполе. В 1775 году его учитель Ж.-Ж. Новерр был назначен главным балетмейстером балетной труппы Парижской Оперы (l'Opera de Paris) и пригласил туда Шарля Ле Пика. С 1776 по 1781 гг. Ле Пик работал в Парижской Опере, где стал постоянным партнером выдающейся балерины Мари Гимар. Однако творческая атмосфера в Парижской Опере была непростой: реформаторские взгляды Новерра не находили понимания как у многих танцоров, желавших работать в устоявшихся и привычных для них рамках, так и у театральных завсегдатаев. Новерр получил приглашение в Лондонский театр ""Друри-Лейн""[5] и покинул пост в Парижской Опере. В 1782 году Ле Пик тоже уехал в Лондон вместе с Новерром. Там в Лондоне под руководством своего педагога он начал ставить самостоятельно свои первые хореографические композиции. Сам Новерр высоко ценил своего верного ученика и отзывался о нем в своей известной книге: Шарль Ле Пик ""довёл своё искусство до совершенства""[6].
1783-1785 - балетмейстер Королевского театра в Лондоне.
[править]В России
В 1787 году Шарль Ле Пик был приглашен в Россию, в Санкт-Петербург, куда он и прибыл со своей семьей: женой балериной Гертрудой Росси и ее сыном, то есть своим пасынком, 11-летним Карло Джиованни Росси, - на должность первого танцора императорской труппы, а в 1792 он стал там же главным балетмейстером и занимал эту должность вплоть до 1799. В России он стал провозвестником и первым пропагандистом новаторских идей своего учителя Новерра: он перенес на Петербургскую сцену несколько его балетных спектаклей и поставил собственные представления, основанные тоже на эстетике реформаторских взглядов Новерра. А кроме того он стал организатором издания на русском языке главного труда своего педагога - многотомной книги ""Записки о танце и балете"" (фр. ""Lettres sur la danse et les ballets"", первое издание в Лионе и Штутгарте в 1760 году), вышедшей в Петербурге под названием ""Письма о танце"" в 1803-1804 годах - эта работа выдержала несколько изданий и переиздается в том же переводе вплоть до настоящего времени[7]. Известный русско-французский балетный деятель Б. Кохно через много лет сказал: ""Новер преобразил танец своей эпохи, а его балет-пантомима достиг России благодаря его ученику Ле Пику""[1].
Для творчества Ле Пика были характерны постановки медленных адажио с позировками, он вносил в аллегро прыжки с заносками и пируэты - все то, что плотно вошло в практику русского балетного исполнительского искусства[1].
В 1799 Ле Пик был отстранен от должности главного балетмейстера, однако оставался в Петербурге и продолжал служить там же, на императорской сцене, как танцовщик. Кроме того, он преподавал французской манеру танца в петербургской театральной школе и в крепостном театре Н. П. Шереметева.
В конце жизни Ле Пик неоднократно ставил дворцовые празднества при дворе Екатерины II. В Петербурге он оставался до конца своих дней, там же и скончался.
Его деятельность в России стала продолжением воцарения на русской сцене французской балетной школы (одновременно в России господствовала и итальянская хореографическая школа, привезенная итальянскими хореографами: Гаспаро Анжиолини, Джузеппе (или в переделке на русский язык Иосиф) Канциани[8]), заложенной еще танцовщиком Ж.-Б.Ланде во время царствования Анны Иоанновны; Шарль Ле Пик окончательно упрочил в русском балете французский стиль, хотя при этом не чурался работы и с итальянскими мастерами.
Считается, что своей деятельностью в Петербурге он подготовил и открыл путь другому выдающему французскому хореографу, занявшему пост главному балетмейстера императорских театров в 1801 году, - Шарлю Дидло.
